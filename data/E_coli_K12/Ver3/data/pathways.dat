COMMENT - Enteric bacteria must be able to survive extremely acidic conditions in order pass through the
/stomachs of their hosts.  <I>E. coli</I> contains acid resistance systems in order to maintain
/an internal pH of about 4.0 to 5.0 in a highly acidic environment with a pH of 2.0 to 2.5.  Acid
/resistance system 3 (AR3) is the arginine-dependent acid resistance system which couples
/the transport activity of an arginine:agmatine antiporter, AdiC, with arginine decarboxylase, AdiA. 
/AdiC functions by exchanging external arginine for internal agmatine.  Arginine is imported into
/the cell through AdiC.  Within the cell arginine is decarboxylated by AdiA to agmatine, releasing
/CO<sub>2</sub> and replacing it with a proton.  Agmatine is then exported through AdiC. 
/This effectively consumes protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH.  An additional effect
/of the acid resistance systems that may be more important for survival is a reversal of the
/membrane potential such that a build-up of positive charges within the cell due to influx of protons
/and increased agmatine concentrations will counteract proton influx beyond a certain limit. 
/ClC chloride channels provide a control mechanism to help maintain appropriate membrane
/potential by mediating chloride import coupled to proton export.  AR2 is more efficient than AR3
/or AR4 as a mediator of acid resistance at low pH. |CITS:[15494746],[12964244]|

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/<i>De novo</i> biosynthesis of purines starts with the synthesis of IMP which can be converted to all other purines.  In <i>E. coli</i> IMP is synthesized in a total of 11 enzymatic reactions in which the purine ring is formed by stepwise addition of small molecules to 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose-1-phosphate (PRPP).  The first five reactions are shown in the two pathway links, which illustrate the alternative use of two phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferases encoded by <i>purN</i> and  <i>purT</i>.  The last six reactions are shown in this pathway.
/
/In bacteria, genetic studies have indicated that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked, but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the PurR repressor protein.  The purine biosynthetic pathway is also regulated by the products GMP and AMP which allosterically inhibit the first enzyme of the pathway |FRAME: PRPPAMIDOTRANS-CPLX| (PurF) (as shown in the pathway links). 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> IMP is synthesized from 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole (AIR) in six steps, catalyzed by five enzymes.  The first four steps are catalyzed by |FRAME: PURK-CPLX| (PurK), |FRAME: PURE-CPLX| (PurE), |FRAME: SAICARSYN-CPLX| (PurC), and |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (PurB), respectively.  The last two steps are catalyzed by a single, bifunctional, folate-dependent enzyme, |FRAME: AICARTRANSIMPCYCLO-CPLX| (PurH).
/
/
/In contrast to higher eukaryotes in which 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole (AIR) is directly carboxylated to 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate (CAIR) by a single enzyme, in bacteria and yeast AIR is converted to CAIR in two steps.  In <i>E. coli</i> the <i>N<sup>5</sup></i> of AIR is carboxylated to form the unstable intermediate <i>N<sup>5</sup></i>-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (<i>N<sup>5</sup></i>-CAIR) by PurK and then <i>N<sup>5</sup></i>-CAIR is converted to CAIR by PurE |CITS: [8117684 ][19053251]|.
/
/In the next reaction PurC catalyzes the ligation of the carboxylate group of CAIR to the amino group of aspartate to form 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole (SAICAR).  This amino group becomes the N(1) nitrogen atom of the final purine base.  The remaining portion of the aspartate molecule is eliminated in the next reaction as fumarate, with the formation of aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) catalyzed by PurB.  PurB is an enzyme with dual substrate specificity which also catalyzes an analogous reaction in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6126|.  In the penultimate reaction a formyl group is transferred to AICAR to form phosphoribosyl-formamido-carboxamide (FAICAR), catalyzed by the bifunctional PurH which also catalyzes cyclization of FAICAR to IMP with elimination of water |CITS: [18712276]|.

COMMON-NAME - 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3445030965:keseler
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE| (DHNA) is a branch point metabolite leading to the biosynthesis of menaquinone (vitamin K2, in bacteria), phylloquinone (vitamin K1, in plants), and many plant pigments, including some two-ring naphthoquinones (such as lawsone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) and the three-ring anthraquinones (such as alizarin and munjistin).  These pigments are mostly found in the plant family Rubiaceae, where at least some of them are phytoalexins involved in plant defense.  Many of these pigments were used as dyes since the early human history.  Menaquinone (MK) or vitamin K2 is an essential nutrient for mammals as they are unable to synthesize it.  
/
/The benzenoid ring (or A ring) of DHNA is derived from |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, synthesized via the shikimate pathway.  The quinone ring (or B ring) of DHNA is formed by addition of |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first step of the pathway, conversion of chorismate to isochorismate, is also the first step in the biosynthesis of enterobactin.  <i>E. coli</i> encodes two enzymes that are able to catalyze this reaction; |FRAME: MENF-CPLX "MenF"| is specific for this pathway. 
/
/Addition of the succinic semialdehyde moiety of 2-oxoglutarate to isochorismate, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX0-7525 "MenD"|, results in the formation of |FRAME: CPD-9924 "SEPHCHC"|.  A pyruvoyl group is subsequently eliminated by |FRAME: EG12438-MONOMER "MenH"|, resulting in the prearomatic compound |FRAME: CPD-9923 "SHCHC"|.  Dehydration of this compound by |FRAME: O-SUCCINYLBENZOATE-COA-SYN-MONOMER "MenC"| results in the benzenoid aromatic compound |FRAME: O-SUCCINYLBENZOATE|.  In a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis, |FRAME: MENE-CPLX "MenE"| subsequently generates |FRAME: CPD-6972 "<i>o</i>-succinylbenzoyl-CoA"|.  A dehydration reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX0-7882 "MenB"| results in the formation of |FRAME: CPD-9925 "DHNA-CoA"|.  The final reaction, hydrolysis of DHNA-CoA to form |FRAME: DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE|, was recently found to be catalyzed by |FRAME: G6912-MONOMER| |CITS: [23564174]|.

/
/|FRAME: PHENYLACETATE Phenylacetate| is a major intermediate in bacterial degradation of many aromatic compounds |CITS: [11260461]|.  Microbes can oxidize phenylacetate under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (see also |FRAME: PWY-1341|), and the first step in both pathways is the same - the activition of phenylacetate to |FRAME: CPD-207| by a phenylacetate-CoA ligase.
/
/Despite the fact that the existence of an aerobic pathway was reported back in 1955 |CITS: [Kunita55]|, the exact chemistry, which is unusual for an aerobic pathway, was solved only in 2010 |CITS: [20660314]|.  All of the pathway's intermediates remain in the form of CoA-thioesters, a characteristic typical of anaerobic degradation pathways. 
/
/Phenylacetate is first converted to phenylacetyl-CoA by phenylacetate-CoA ligase.  De-aromatization of the ring is achieved by activation of |FRAME: CPD-207| to the highly unstable |FRAME: CPD0-2362|, catalyzed by PaaABCE, a multicomponent oxygenase.  The reactive non-aromatic epoxide is then isomerized to the highly unusual unsaturated, oxygen-containing seven-member <i>o</i>-heterocyclic enol ether, |FRAME: CPD0-2363|, and the ring is cleaved. The rest of the pathway consists of &beta;-oxidation steps leading to formation of the TCA cycle intermediates |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME: SUC-COA| |CITS: [17259607][20660314]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straightforward.  A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.  
/
/Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types of pathways - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towards complete mineralization.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway begins with the nucleotide GMP which can be hydrolyzed by several enzymes to the nucleoside guanosine.  Guanosine is converted to the free base guanine by the phosphorylases DeoD or XapA (EC 2.4.2.1), which also participate in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6620|.  However, the salvage pathway ends with the nucleotide GMP from which other guanosine nucleotides are biosynthesized, while this degradation pathway ends with urate.  Guanine is converted to urate via xanthine by the enzymes guanine deaminase and a putative xanthine oxidase |CITS: [10986234]|.  In most organisms urate is degraded further, providing the organism with carbon, nitrogen and energy.  However, this does not appear to be the case in <i>E. coli</i>.  Although radiolabeled carbon experiments have indicated the presence of a uricase activity that catalyzes the degradation of urate to <i>S</i>-allantoin, no such enzyme has been characterized in <i>E. coli</i>.  Xanthine degradation does not progress past <i>S</i>-allantoin or allantoate and this catabolism does not suffice as a source of nitrogen under aerobic growth conditions |CITS: [10986234]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway shares several steps with the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6609|. However, the salvage pathway starts with the free base adenine and ends with the nucleotide IMP which leads to biosynthesis of other nucleotides, while this degradation pathway starts with the nucleotide form (AMP) and ends with urate.  In most organisms urate is degraded further, providing the organism with carbon, nitrogen and energy.  However, this does not appear to be the case in <i>E. coli</i>.  Although radiolabeled carbon experiments have indicated the presence of a uricase activity that catalyzes the degradation of urate to <i>S</i>-allantoin, no such enzyme has been characterized in <i>E. coli</i>.  Xanthine degradation does not progress past <i>S</i>-allantoin or allantoate and this catabolism does not suffice as a source of nitrogen under aerobic growth conditions |CITS: [10986234]|.  As shown in the pathway, a number of different nucleotidases can potentially hydrolyze AMP to adenosine and phosphate.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway that is described here is a degradation pathway found in some bacteria, that typically feeds into a salvage pathway as indicated by the pathway links. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 this pathway is the major route of AMP catabolism. AMP degradation is not necessarily used for energy production, but is often required for maintaining the ATP to AMP ratio at relatively constant levels in the face of declining absolute levels of ATP. Thus, partial degradation of AMP to a product that can be recycled to the nucleotide later is desirable.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: AMP-NUCLEOSID-CPLX| (EC 3.2.2.4| can convert AMP into adenine in a single step |CITS: [7000783]|. The adenine that is produced in the nucleosidase reaction can be reincorporated into the purine pool via the salvage pathways |CITS: [7000783] [2690948]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/4-Aminobutyrate (&gamma;-aminobutyrate, GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well |CITS: [15003233]|.  In animals and plants GABA is produced by the cytosolic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase.  
/In enteric bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, 4-aminobutyrate is produced by glutamate decarboxylase as part of the acid resistance system 2 (AR2) (see |FRAME: PWY0-1305|).  It is also produced as an intermediate in putrescine degradation (see |FRAME: PWY-6535|) |CITS: [20639325]|.
/
/The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to succinate semialdehyde followed by oxidation to succinate. The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either 2-oxoglutarate in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]| and bacteria |CITS: [1201024]|, or pyruvate in plants |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|.
/
/Many bacteria have the ability to degrade GABA which is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay.  The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> |CITS:[13654294][13654295]|.  While some organisms such as <i>P. fluorescens</i> can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source |CITS: [8951816][12123465]|.  <i>E. coli</i> can use GABA as a nitrogen source, and mutational loss of the |FRAME: EG12386-MONOMER| encoded by <i>csiR</i> (<i>gabC</i>) allows it to utilize GABA as a carbon source |CITS: [12446648]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/GABA is transported into the cell by a specific transporter, the GabP permease as shown in the reaction link |CITS: [28310][8297211]|.  The GABA degradation pathway variant shown here includes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent 4-aminobutyrate transaminase and a NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent dehydrogenase.    All three enzymes are induced by nitrogen limitation |CITS: [12446648]|.  <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 substr. MG1655 also has a second dehydrogenase, a |FRAME: CPLX0-7687| Sad (see |FRAME: PWY-6535|).  Only the GabD |FRAME: CPLX0-7688| is induced by GABA.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> B also has two dehydrogenases.  A NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzyme is induced by growth on GABA coordinately with &gamma;-aminobutyrate transaminase, and a NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzyme (NAD<sup>+</sup>-preferring) is induced by growth on <i>p</i>-hydroxyphenylacetate, or exposure to exogenous succinic semialdehyde.  In <i>E. coli</i> B grown with GABA as sole nitrogen source, both enzymes are induced, with the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzyme presumably induced by the succinic semialdehyde produced |CITS: [7011797]|.
/
/Proposed physiological functions for this pathway include polyamine homeostasis |CITS: [12446648]| and response to environmental stresses |CITS: [12107143][14731280]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well. 
/
/The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD|, followed by oxidation to |FRAME: SUC|.  Different variants of both enzymes are known.  The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain) or |FRAME:PYRUVATE| (e.g. in the plant |FRAME: ORG-5862|).  Different variants of the second enzyme, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, were shown to possess different cofactor requirements, for either NAD+, NADP+, or NAD(P)+.
/
/While there is no evidence for a special role for GABA in bacteria, the capability to degrade it exists in many strains.  GABA is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay, and many bacteria synthesize GABA as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation "putrescine degradation"|). 
/
/The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in |FRAME: TAX-294|.  While some organisms, like |FRAME: TAX-294|, can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source.

/
/This variant of the pathway includes a |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|-dependent 4-aminobutyrate transaminase and an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase.  This combination of enzymes has been documented in bacteria and animals and in some plants.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In prokaryotes and eukaryotes heme (protoheme IX, protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.  Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as protoheme IX, different derivatives of protoheme IX can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including the way it is bound to the protein, such as heme <i>o</i>, heme <i>a</i>, heme <i>c</i>, and heme <i>d</i>.
/
/In various organisms important branch points within the heme biosynthetic pathway lead to the biosynthesis of other important compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), coenzyme F430 (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5196|), siroheme (see EcoCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5194|), heme D (see EcoCyc reaction |FRAME: RXN-8073|), and bacteriochlorophyll (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> heme biosynthesis begins with L-glutamate and proceeds through 5-amino-levulinate (the universal tetrapyrrole precursor) to uroporphyrinogen III as shown in the |FRAME: PWY-5188| pathway link.  Uroporphyrinogen III is converted to protoheme IX in the pathway shown here.  Subsequent reactions that produce heme <i>o</i> and heme <i>d</i> are shown in the reaction links.  In <i>E. coli</i> hemes <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>o</i> function as the prosthetic groups for <i>c</i>-type cytochromes, cytochrome <i>bd</i>, and cytochrome <i>bo</i>, respectively.  The <i>c</i>-type cytochromes are synthesized only anaerobically in the presence of nitrogenous electron acceptors.  Cytochrome <i>bd</i>, and cytochrome <i>bo</i> are O<sub>2</sub>-reducing terminal oxidase complexes.
/
/Although regulation of heme biosynthesis is not well studied in <i>E. coli</i>, evidence suggests that the cellular level of free protoheme IX controls the rate of heme synthesis at the level of formation of glutamate-1-semialdehyde by glutamyl-tRNA reductase encoded by <i>hemA</i> (see EcoCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5188|).

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here from uroporphyrinogen III to protoheme IX is a segment of the overall heme biosynthetic pathway. The pathway links at the beginning and end of this pathway show the preceding and succeeding steps.  The main difference between this protoheme biosynthetic pathway and the pathway shown in |FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II| is the presence of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.22), which can catalyze the transition from coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX without the need for molecular oxygen.  This enzyme is found in many bacteria, but has not been verified to be present in archaea or eukaryotes.
/
/In this pathway the four acetate groups of uroporphyrinogen III are sequentially decarboxylated and the methyl groups from these four acetates remain in coproporphyrinogen III.  Two propionate groups at positions 3 and 8 of coproporphyrinogen III are decarboxylated to vinyl groups.  In  the facultatively aerobic <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the O<sub>2</sub>-independent enzyme coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase encoded by gene <i>hemN</i> can function under anaerobic conditions.  HemN contains an O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster |CITS: [14633981]|.  Under aerobic conditions the O<sub>2</sub>-requiring product of gene <i>hemF</i> produces protoporphyrinogen IX |CITS: [12975365]| (see pathway |FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II|).
/
/In the next step six electrons are removed from protoporphyrinogen IX by a membrane-associated oxidase encoded by gene <i>hemG</i> forming protoporphyrin IX. In <i>E. coli</i> under anaerobic conditions this oxidation is coupled to the reduction of nitrate or fumarate.  Under aerobic conditions this enzyme uses O<sub>2</sub> as electron acceptor |CITS: [20484676][365243]| (see pathway |FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II|).  The final step forming heme (protoheme IX) is catalyzes by ferrichelatase which inserts Fe<sup>2+</sup> into protoporphyrin IX.

In  the facultatively aerobic <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, an O<sub>2</sub>-independent enzyme, coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase encoded by gene <i>hemN</i> can function under anaerobic conditions.  HemN contains an O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster |CITS: [14633981]| (see pathway |FRAME: HEMESYN2-PWY|).
/
/In the next step six electrons are removed from protoporphyrinogen IX by a membrane-associated oxidase encoded by gene <i>hemG</i> forming protoporphyrin IX. In <i>E. coli</i> under aerobic conditions this enzyme uses O<sub>2</sub> as electron acceptor, while under anaerobic conditions oxidation is coupled to the reduction of nitrate or fumarate |CITS: [20484676][365243]|.  The final step forming heme (protoheme IX) is catalyzes by ferrichelatase which inserts Fe<sup>2+</sup> into protoporphyrin IX.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can utilize L- and D-alanine as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy |CITS: [13292]|.
/
/Through this single pathway either L- or D-alanine can be degraded to pyruvate, which enters central metabolism and thereby can serve as a total source of carbon and energy.  This pathway is unique among those through which L-amino acids are degraded, in that the L form must first be converted to the D form.  This first step of the pathway, which can be catalyzed by either of two racemases, also serves an essential role in biosynthesis because its product, D-alanine, is an essential component of cell wall peptidoglycan (murein).  The role of the <i>alr</i> racemase is predominately biosynthetic: it is produced constitutively in small amounts.  The role of the <i>dadX</i> racemase is degradative: it is induced to high levels by alanine and is subject to catabolite repression.

TYPES - Ascorbate-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - L-ascorbate degradation II (bacterial, aerobic)
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE|, also known as vitamin C, fulfils multiple essential roles in both plants and animals. Being a strong reducing agent, it functions as an antioxidant and a redox buffer. It is also a cofactor for several enzymes, which are involved in many important pathways, including collagen hydroxylation, carnitine biosynthesis, norepinephrine biosynthesis, and hormone and tyrosine metabolism.
/
/Under aerobic conditions L-ascorbate is oxidized in cells to |FRAME: CPD-13907 dehydroascorbate| (via the radical |FRAME: CPD-318|), which can be recycled back to ascorbate by the |FRAME: PWY-2261|. However, once formed, dehydroascorbate can be further broken down <i>in vivo</i> by irreversible reactions, escaping the  |FRAME: PWY-2261|.
/
/Several pathways for the irreversible catabolism of ascorbate have been described. Facultatively aerobic bacteria such as  |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-573| degrade L-ascorbate by different pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (see |FRAME: PWY-6961| and |FRAME: PWY0-301|). The anaerobic pathway begins with phosphorylation of ascorbate (mediated by a PTS-type transporter), while the aerobic pathway proceeds via |FRAME: CPD-334|. Both pathways produce |FRAME: XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE|, a centeral metabolite that is fed into the pentose phosphate pathway |CITS: [18708499]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Under anaerobic conditions |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-573| degrade |FRAME: ASCORBATE| via |FRAME: L-ASCORBATE-6-PHOSPHATE| utilizing the enzymes encoded by the <i>ula</i> regulon (see |FRAME: PWY0-301|). Under aerobic conditions L-ascorbate is auto-oxidized to |FRAME: CPD-334|, which can not be degraded by the anaerobic pathway. A different set of enzymes, encoded by the <i>yiaK-S</i> operon, enables the cells to catabolize L-ascorbate under aerobic conditions as well |CITS: [18708499]|.
/
/The yiaK-S operon, which is controled by the YiaJ repressor, encodes two unique proteins - a reductase (|FRAME: EG12279|) and a kinase (|FRAME: EG12284 yiaP|) as well as three proteins that are paralogous to <i>ula</i> operon proteins: a carboxylase (|FRAME: EG12285 yiaQ|) and two epimerases (|FRAME: EG12287 yiaS| and |FRAME: EG12286 yiaR|) (note tha many of these genes are now known under different names). YiaK and YiaP convert |FRAME: CPD-334| to |FRAME: CPD-2343|, which can be processed by the rest of the enzymes to |FRAME: XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE|, a centeral metabolite that is fed into the pentose phosphate pathway.
/
/Curiously, the <i>yia</i> regulon is also regulated by |FRAME: L-ASCORBATE-6-PHOSPHATE|, a metabolite that can only be produced by the |FRAME: EIISGA|, which is encoded by the <i>ula</i> regulon. Thus, efficient aerobic metabolism of L-ascorbate is dependent on the presence of both systems. In addition, the expression of the <i>yiaK-S</i> operon, but not the expression of the <i>ula</i> regulon, is regulated by oxygen availability. Both systems are regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex and by IHF |CITS: [18708499]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are formed through metabolic processes and various environmental stresses such as drought, air pollutants, UV light and high light intensities, chilling temperatures and external chemicals |CITS: [VANBREUSGEM99][11997379]|.  For example, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during the &beta;-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result of photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms |CITS: [8819328]|.  ROS such as |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| and hydroxyl radicals as well as |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| can cause significant damage to proteins, nucleic acids and cell organelles. 
/
/Most of the aerobic organisms have developed defense systems to face oxidative stress and to scavenge oxidative radicals in the form of enzymes that can detoxify ROS, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase/hydroperoxidase (HP) |CITS: [BEYER87]|.  SODs represent the first line of defense against ROS, converting |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| radicals to |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and water.  SODs are differentiated with regard to their metal cofactor.  There are iron-dependent, manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent SODs, which differ not only in their metal cofactor, but also in their subcellular location. Catalase is second in the defense line against active oxygen, converting |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| into water and oxygen.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Gram-negative bacteria commonly synthesize both cytoplasmic and periplasmic isozymes of SOD as their frontline defense against superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>).  <i>E. coli</i> contains two cytoplasmic SOD isozymes, one each of the manganese- and iron-cofactored types (MnSOD and FeSOD), and secretes a copper, zinc-cofactored enzyme (CuZnSOD) to the periplasm.  Periplasmic superoxide may be generated by autooxidation of dihydromenaquinone in the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [16923900]|. 
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, the |FRAME: SUPEROX-DISMUTMN-CPLX "MnSOD"| and |FRAME: SUPEROX-DISMUTFE-CPLX "FeSOD"| enzymes (encoded by <i>sodA</i> and <i>sodB</i>, respectively) are structurally and kinetically similar.  Unlike MnSOD and FeSOD, |FRAME: G6886-MONOMER "CuZnSOD"| is monomeric |CITS: [7589534][9003353]|.  Regulation of the three enzymes is complex.  Under anaerobic conditions, FeSOD is the only superoxide dismutase enzyme present in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [321433][8002590]|.  MnSOD is induced by aerobic growth and a variety of environmental stress conditions.  CuZnSOD constitutes only a small fraction of superoxide dismutase activity in the cell; its expression is induced in stationary phase |CITS: [8626323]|. 
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, with rising H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, catalase is strongly induced and becomes the primary scavenging enzyme.  <i>E. coli</i> expresses two catalases, known as HPI and HPII, that are encoded by <i>katG</i> and <i>katE</i>, respectively.  While <i>katG katE</i> mutants could not degrade millimolar concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, they were subsequently found to retain the ability to degrade H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when it was present at low micromolar concentrations |CITS: [11717276]|.  This residual activity is due to an enzyme known as alkylhydroperoxide reductase (Ahp).  This two-component enzyme had originally been identified as a scavenger of organic hydroperoxides |CITS: [2643600]|. 
/
/SOD mutants of <i>E. coli</i> are unable to perform normal sulfur metabolism.  Both SOD and catalase/peroxidase mutants of <i>E. coli</i> are incapable of synthesizing aromatic products, including amino acids |CITS: [18173371]|. 
/
/SoxRS regulon is turned on by any condition that increases superoxide radical production in <i>E. coli</i>.  One of its products is Mn-SOD.  Another independent regulon turned on in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is referred to as the OxyR regulon |CITS: [9228011]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typically consist of a hydrophobic domain inserted into the outer membrane known as lipid A (or endotoxin), a phosphorylated "core" oligosaccharide and a distal polysaccharide (or O antigen). The core oligosaccharides are conceptually divided into two regions: inner core and outer core. The inner core is highly conserved, comprises three deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) and L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) and is often phosphorylated. The inner core oligosaccharide plays a critical role in essential barrier function of the outer membrane. The outer core comprises a tri-hexose backbone modified with varying side-branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues. The outer core provides an attachment site for O-antigen. Strains of <i>E. coli</i> K12 normally do not make O-antigen, unless a mutation in the O-antigen operon is corrected |CITS: [7517391]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The completed lipid A-KDO<sub>2</sub> serves as the acceptor on which the core oligosaccharide chains are assembled by sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors. This process involves a co-ordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases acting at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Many of the enzymes are predicted to be peripheral proteins. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> mutants that lack the heptose region of the inner core display "deep rough" phenotypes and causes instability of the outer membrane. These mutants lose expression of pili and flagella and secrete hemolysin with reduced activity. Mutations that eliminate synthesis of the outer core result in enhanced susceptibility to some hydrophobic compounds due to an indirect effect on core phosphorylation.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Purine bases consist of a six-membered and a five-membered nitrogen-containing rings fused together. There are four purine bases, namely |FRAME: ADENINE|, |FRAME: GUANINE|, |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE| and |FRAME: XANTHINE|. Purine nucleotides may be synthesized <i>de novo</i> from simpler precursors, or they may be derived from exogenous purine nucleosides and bases by the salvage pathways.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, the salvage pathways collect exogenous, preformed bases and nucleosides for nucleotide synthesis, reutilize bases and nucleosides produced endogenously from nucleotide turnover, and make available the pentose moieties of exogenous nucleosides as sources of carbon. When free bases or nucleosides present in the growth medium are salvaged, the contribution from the <i>de novo</i> pathways to nucleotide synthesis is greatly suppressed.  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: XANTHOSINE Xanthosine| is converted to |FRAME: XANTHINE| by |FRAME: XANTHOSINEPHOSPHORY-CPLX|, one of the two purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNPs) in <i>E. coli</i>, encoded by the |FRAME: G85| gene |CITS: [7559336][15808857]|. This enzyme does not cleave or synthesize adenosine and deoxyadenosine but catalyzes the phosphorolysis of |FRAME: XANTHOSINE|, |FRAME: INOSINE| and |FRAME: GUANOSINE| with comparable efficiency.
/
/|FRAME: XANTHINE Xanthine| is converted to |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE| by |FRAME: GPT-CPLX|, a purine salvage enzyme which converts either xanthine or guanine to |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE| or |FRAME: GMP|, respectively |CITS: [6305942][3886014]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The glyoxylate cycle is a sequence of anaplerotic reactions that enables an organism to use substrates
/that enter central carbon metabolism at the level of |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| as the sole carbon source. 
/Such substrates include fatty acids, alcohols, and esters (often the products of fermentation), as well as
/waxes, alkenes, and methylated compounds.
/
/The pathway is essentially a modified version of the |FRAME:TCA| that bypasses those steps in the cycle
/that lead to a loss of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.  The glyoxylate cycle uses a two-step bypass.  The first
/key enzyme, |FRAME:ISOCIT-LYASE| (EC 4.1.3.1), converts |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| to form
/|FRAME: SUC| and |FRAME: GLYOX|.  The second key enzyme, |FRAME: MALATE-SYNTHASE|
/(EC 2.3.3.9), condenses glyoxylate and another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form |FRAME:MAL|.  The
/subsequent oxidation of malate regenerates the initial acetyl-CoA acceptor molecule of the TCA cycle,
/|FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|.  In this way any intermediate of the TCA cycle can be withdrawn from the
/cycle and used for cell carbon biosynthesis.
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the pathway is active when growth on two-carbon compounds requires
/conservation of four-carbon TCA intermediates.  Two acetyl-CoA are taken up per turn.  The glyoxylate
/cycle is repressed during growth on glucose and induced by growth on acetate

COMMENT - Acetate plays multiple roles in the metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>.  In the absence of other substrates
/acetate can serve as a total source of carbon and energy (see |FRAME: PWY0-1313|).
/During sugar fermentation (under anaerobic conditions), acetate is produced and excreted into the
/medium (by a mechanism that is not yet clearly established) as a major fermentation product.
/Acetate is also produced during aerobic growth in the presence of glucose. Again, acetate is excreted
/in significant amounts into the medium, usually to be utilized later, when glucose is depleted.
/All these transformations of acetate flow through one or the other of the two parallel pathways
/shown here. 
/
/The <i>ack-pta</i> pathway, which is constitutively expressed, participates the aerobic utilization of
/acetate and in its excretion both aerobically and anaerobically. 
/
/In contrast the <i>acs</i> pathway is an inducible pathway that plays a major role in the aerobic
/utilization of acetate. Because it is a high-affinity system, the <i>acs</i> pathway is the major scavenger
/of acetate when extracellular concentrations of it are low.  It also enables <i>E. coli</i> to utilize
/propionate. Mutant strains blocked in the <i>acs</i> pathway grow poorly on acetate.
/
/Mutants blocked in both pathways are unable to grow on acetate.  
/<i>E. coli</i> is one of very few organisms that possess both pathways.

COMMON-NAME - citrate degradation
CITATIONS - 6354265:EV-EXP-IDA:3650058401:fulcher
COMMENT - Citrate lyase is an anaerobic enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of |FRAME: CIT citrate| to |FRAME: ACET acetate| and |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID oxaloacetate| |CITS: [6354265]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6038 citrate degradation|). Because the citrate molecule is very stable, it has to be activated by forming a thioester bond with the enzyme before cleavage can take place.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/The acp protein is synthesized in an <i>apo</i> form, and is converted to its fully active form in two steps - first, a <i>holo</i> form is generated by the covalent binding of the prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA| to a serine residue. Next, the <i>holo</i> form is acetylated, either by |FRAME: EC-6.2.1.22 EC 6.2.1.22, [citrate (<em>pro</em>-3<em>S</em>)-lyase] ligase|, which uses |FRAME: ACET acetate| as the donor, or by |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.49 EC 2.3.1.49, deacetyl-[citrate-(<em>pro</em>-3<em>S</em>)-lyase] <em>S</em>-acetyltransferase|, that uses |FRAME: S-ACETYLPHOSPHOPANTETHEINE S-acetyl phosphopantetheine| as the acetyl donor (see |FRAME: P2-PWY citrate lyase activation|).

COMMENT - This multi-enzyme complex, which consists of 24 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, 24 subunits of
/lipoate acetyltransferase, and 12 subunits of dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase, catalyzes three reactions,
/which constitute a cycle.  The complex contains a lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as
/a thiamin diphosphate. 
/
/The net consequence of the cycle, in addition to reducing NAD+, is the conversion of pyruvate into
/acetyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>, a key reaction of central metabolism because it links glycolysis I,
/which generates pyruvate, to the TCA cycle, into which the acetyl-CoA flows.
/
/During aerobic growth the cycle is an essential source of acetyl-CoA to feed the TCA cycle and thereby
/to satisfy the cellular requirements for the precursor metabolites it forms.  Mutant strains defective in the
/complex require an exogenous source of acetate to meet this requirement, but anaerobically such
/mutants grow without exogenous acetate because under such conditions, pyruvate formate lyase
/generates acetyl-CoA from pyruvate.  Mutant strains lacking pyruvate formate lyase have the reverse
/phenotype.  They require acetate for anaerobic but not for aerobic growth.

CITATIONS - 22636776:EV-EXP:3622381113:keseler
COMMENT - 4-aminobutyrate (or &gamma;-aminobutyrate, GABA) is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay.  In many bacteria, GABA can be synthesized as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation|).  <i>E. coli</i> K-12 can utilize GABA as the sole source of nitrogen with a slow generation time of approximately 400 minutes |CITS: [12446648]|.  It was initially reported that <i>E. coli</i> K-12 can not utilize GABA as the sole source of either nitrogen or carbon; mutants that have gained both abilities can be isolated |CITS: [4550821]| and may affect regulation. 
/
/The first reaction of this pathway, the transfer of the amino group from GABA to 2-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate and succinate semialdehyde, can be catalyzed by two independently expressed  4-aminobutyrate aminotransferases.  Succinate semialdehyde is a toxic intermediate; two dehydrogenases with differing cosubstrate requirements catalyze its detoxification by dehydrogenation to succinate.
/
/Mutants in the <i>gab</i> operon are still able to grow on putrescine due to the presence of the alternative putrescine degradation pathway (|FRAME: PWY0-1221|) which includes the alternative |FRAME: G6646-MONOMER|.
/
/While all tested nitrogen sources induce this pathway, it does not contribute to the catabolism of any other nitrogen source but GABA |CITS: [12446648]|.  The authors speculate that the main purpose of this pathway is to keep putrescine concentrations in check during nitrogen-limited growth |CITS: [12446648]|.  Regulation of expression of the <i>gab</i> enzymes in this pathway is complex and may involve post-transcriptional control mechanisms |CITS: [14731280]|.

/The initial steps in fatty acid biosynthesis catalyze the production of the first major intermediate, acetoacetyl-ACP, from the precursor |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|.  There are several alternate ways to generate this intermediate from |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, which involve some combination of the intermediates |FRAME:MALONYL-COA|, |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP|, and acetyl-ACP.  These early reactions in the biosynthesis of fatty acids can use either |FRAME: ACP-MONOMER| (ACP) or |FRAME: CO-A| to activate intermediates.  The pathway illustrated here depicts the use of |FRAME: ACP-MONOMER| compounds for this purpose.

COMMON-NAME - NAD salvage pathway III
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell.  Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions.  Because of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these compounds are often depicted as NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, respectively.
/
/Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms.  In reactions where NAD or NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate.  During the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> (or NADP<sup>+</sup>), the molecule acquires two electrons and one proton, while the second proton is released into the medium.  Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in the form:
/
/NAD<sup>+</sup> + 2H -> NADH + H<sup>+</sup>
/
/Additional roles for NAD in the cell have been suggested, including involvement in transcriptional regulation, longevity, and age-associated diseases.  In yeast, it has been shown that NAD affects longevity and transcriptional silencing through the regulation of the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases |CITS: [12648681][14724176]|.
/
/NAD is synthesized via two major pathways in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the <i>de novo</i> pathway, and the salvage pathway.  In the prokaryotic <i>de novo</i> pathway, the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate (see |FRAME: PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|, while in eukaryotes the <i>de novo</i> pathway starts with  tryptophan (|FRAME: NADSYN-PWY|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway is an NAD salvage pathway which proceeds via the intermediate nicotinamide riboside (<i>N</i>-ribosylnicotinamide, or NR).  While the presence of this pathway has been suggested for several organisms including <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS: [12446641]|, it is of particular importance to <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and other V-factor-dependent members of the <i>Pasteurella</i> family.  These organisms lack the enzymes necessary for the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of NAD, as well as most of the enzymes for the more common NAD salvage pathway, and therefore require exogenous NAD supply in the form of one of the V-factor compounds, which include NADP, NAD, NMN, and NR.  However, only the non-phosphorylated V factor, NR, can be transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm, where it can be converted to NAD and NADP |CITS: [12446641]|.  Thus this pathway is critical for these organisms |CITS: [1694467]|.  
/
/Since NAD<sup>+</sup>, which is obtained from extracellular sources, is highly polar, it has to be hydrolyzed before it can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane for final uptake.  A key enzyme in this pathway is a periplasmic protein that hydrolyzes NAD<sup>+</sup> to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and hydrolyzes NMN to nicotinamide riboside (NR) |CITS: [11395461]|.  The nicotinamide riboside thus formed is transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm, where it is it is converted back to NMN, and eventually, to NAD<sup>+</sup>.
/
/The identity of the NR transporter has not been confirmed experimentally, but it is suggested that it is encoded by the <i>pnuC</i> gene, although earlier work with the PnuC protein of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium suggested that it encodes the transport of NMN |CITS: [6216244][11395461]|.
/
/NADP<sup>+</sup> is recycled in the same manner, following dephosphorylation to NAD<sup>+</sup>.  In <i>H. influenzae</i>, this dephosphorylation is performed by the outer membrane glycoprotein <i>e</i> (P4), encoded by the <i>hel</i> gene. 
/
/While the pathway is predicted to be present in <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, it probably serves a minor role compared to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis and the main NAD salvage cycle (|FRAME: PYRIDNUCSAL-PWY|).  Some of the enzymatic activities associated with this pathway have been described in <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> as early as 1951 |CITS: [14907738]|, but it was only recently that the genes responsible for them were identified.  Surprisingly, several activities were found to be functions of the multifunctional protein NadR, which was initially believed to have a role in regulation only |CITS: [10464228][12446641]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/<i>De novo</i> biosynthesis of purines starts with the synthesis of IMP which can be converted to all other purines.  In <i>E. coli</i> IMP is synthesized in a total of 11 enzymatic reactions in which the purine ring is formed by stepwise addition of small molecules to 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose-1-phosphate (PRPP).  The first five reactions are shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY-6121| and |FRAME: PWY-6122| which illustrate the alternative use of two phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferases encoded by <i>purN</i> and  <i>purT</i>.  The last six reactions leading to IMP are shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6123|.  IMP can then be converted to guanosine nucleotides as shown in this pathway, or adenosine nucleotides as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6125|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The conversion of IMP to GMP is catalyzed by the consecutive action of |FRAME: IMP-DEHYDROG-CPLX| and |FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX| encoded by <i>guaB</i> and <i>guaA</i>, respectively.  The former enzyme is the first committed step in GMP synthesis.  The latter enzyme catalyzes the replacement of an oxygen atom at the 2-position of XMP with an amino group, utilizing either L-glutamine or ammonia.  The specific kinase product of gene <i>gmk</i> converts GMP to GDP.  GMP can also be supplied by a salvage pathway as indicated by the pathway link.  However, rapidly growing cells may require more GMP than can be supplied by the salvage pathway (reviewed in |CITS: [19480389]|).
/
/Both GDP and GTP can be converted to the deoxy forms of the nucleotide. GTP is converted to dGTP by |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-TRIP-REDUCT-CPLX|, while GDP can be converted to dGDP by either |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX| or |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTII-CPLX|.  Finally, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| can also convert dGDP to dGTP.
/
/In bacteria, genetic studies have indicated that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked, but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the PurR repressor protein |CITS:[2404765]|.

CITATIONS - ecosal:EV-EXP-TAS:3394913492:caspi
COMMENT - In the absence of other substrates, acetate can serve as a total source of carbon and energy for <i>E. coli</i>.  This so-called Acs pathway functions in a mainly anabolic role, scavenging acetate present in the extracellular medium.  Induction of <i>acs</i> expression functions as the metabolic switch activating this pathway |CITS: [10894724][21122111]|.
/
/ Acs activity constitutes one of two distinct pathways by which <i>E. coli</i> activates acetate to acetyl-CoA. 
/The <i>acs</i> pathway is an inducible pathway that plays a major role in the aerobic utilization of
/acetate.  Mutant strains blocked in the <i>acs</i> pathway grow poorly on acetate.  Mutants
/blocked in both pathways are unable to grow on acetate.  Because it is a high-affinity system, the
/<i>acs</i> pathway is the major scavenger of acetate when extracellular concentrations of it are low.
/It also enables <i>E. coli</i> to utilize |FRAME:PROPIONATE|.

COMMON-NAME - L-glutamate degradation IX (via 4-aminobutanoate)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3387296862:djohnson
COMMENT - Enteric bacteria must be able to survive extremely acidic conditions in order pass through the
/stomachs of their hosts.  <I>E. coli</I> contains acid resistance systems in order to maintain
/an internal pH of about 4.0 to 5.0 in a highly acidic environment with a pH of 2.0 to 2.5.  Acid
/resistance system 2 (AR2) is the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system which couples
/the transport activity of a glutamate:4-aminobutyrate antiporter, GadC, with glutamate
/decarboxylase, GadA/GadB.  GadA or GadB is sufficient for survival at pH 2.5, but both GadA and GadB
/are required for survival at pH 2.0.  GadC functions by exchanging external glutamate for internal
/4-aminobutyrate.  Glutamate is imported into the cell through GadC.  Within the cell glutamate is
/decarboxylated by GadA/GadB to 4-aminobutyrate, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> and replacing it
/with a proton.  4-aminobutyrate is then exported through GadC.  This effectively consumes
/protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH.  An additional effect of the acid resistance systems
/that may be more important for survival is a reversal of the membrane potential such that a
/build-up of positive charges within the cell due to influx of protons and conversion of glutamate to
/4-aminobutyrate will counteract proton influx beyond a certain limit.  ClC chloride channels provide
/a control mechanism to help maintain appropriate membrane potential by mediating chloride
/import coupled to proton export.  AR2 is more efficient than AR3 or AR4 as a mediator of acid 
/esistance at low pH. |CITS:[15494746],[12964244]|
/
/AR2 is also able provide acid resistance to <I>E. coli</I> growing under conditions of anaerobiosis
/and phosphate starvation (believed to reflect conditions in the gut), but to a slightly lesser degree
/than the lysine-dependent acid resistance system possibly due to the different pH optimums of their
/respective decarboxylase enzymes. |CITS:[17209032]|

COMMENT - <i>Escherichia coli</i>, a facultative anaerobe, is capable of mediating the mixed acid fermentation and
/thereby, in the absence of any of the exogenous electron acceptors that it can utilize (oxygen, fumarate,
/nitrate, nitrite, trimethylamine oxide, or dimethyl sulfoxide), able to grow on a variety of compounds
/including hexoses, hexitols, hexonic acids, and hexuronic acids.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> ferments only when exogenous electron acceptors are not available.  In the shift from
/exogenous electron-dependent growth to the mixed acid fermentation, pyruvate dehydrogenase is no
/longer synthesized.  Instead, pyruvate formate-lyase, which cleaves pyruvate nonoxidatively to
/formate and acetyl-CoA, is made.  Formate is excreted as formic acid.  Some of the acetyl-CoA enters the
/remnant of the TCA cycle, which terminates at 2-oxoglutarate because 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
/synthesis is repressed.  In spite of such repression, all components of the TCA cycle and therefore its
/essential precursor metabolites, continue to be made by the now two arms of the cycle: one, leading to
/2-oxoglutarate, still oxidatively, and the other, leading to succinate, now reductively.  Succinate is
/excreted as succinic acid.  The acetyl-CoA not needed for these purposes is metabolized via
/acetylphosphate to acetate, thereby generating ATP.  The acetate so formed is excreted as acetic acid.
/
/During the shift to the mixed acid fermentation, three additional enzymes are made: 1) a lactate
/dehydrogenase, which reduces pyruvate to lactate that is excreted as lactic acid; 2) an ethanol
/dehydrogenase, which reduces acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde and subsequently to ethanol, which is
/excreted; 3) formic hydrogen lyase, which cleaves formate to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.  The multiplicity of
/possible endproducts of fermentation with differing oxidation states and acidity permits <i>E. coli</i> to
/maintain redox balance and therefore to grow fermentatively on a broader range of substrates than would
/otherwise be possible.  When growing on a more reduced substrate such as glucitol, greater quantities of
/more reduced endproducts such as ethanol, acetic acid, and lactic acid are produced; on more oxidized
/substrates such as glucuronate, more of the oxidized endproducts, succinic acid and formic acid, are
/made.  Conversion of formate to H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is regulated by pH.

TYPES - Methionine-De-novo-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - L-methionine biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Methionine can be biosynthesized by microorganisms and plants, although mammals cannot biosynthesize methionone <i>de novo</i>.  Methionine is required for many important cellular functions.  It is a basic building block of proteins and is required for the initiation of protein synthesis (via <i>N</i>-formyl-L- methionine).  Methionine is also used in the synthesis of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine which is the major methyl group donor in cellular metabolism.  <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine is also utilized in pathways such as |FRAME: PWY-6153| and |FRAME: BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY|.
/
/Some bacteria including <i>Escherichia coli</i> synthesize methionine using organic sulfur through transsulfuration of <i>O</i>-acylated homoserine with cysteine to form cystathionine.  Cystathionine is then cleaved to homocysteine, and methylated to methionine as shown in this pathway |CITS: [3309561]|.  Other bacteria, yeast and fungi can use a different route in which they directly assimilate inorganic sulfur by a sulfhydrylation (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-5344| and |FRAME:HSERMETANA-PWY|).  While many organisms seem to contain both routes for methionine biosynthesis, in <i>E. coli</i> and other enteric bacteria only the transsulfuration pathway is used.  Reviewed in Greene, R.C. (1996) "Biosynthesis of Methionine" in |CITS: [COLISAL]| pp. 542-560).
/
/The <i>O</i>-acyl group of homoserine is  a succinyl group in enteric bacteria and some other Gram-negative bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomanas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>.  It is an acetyl group in fungi, yeast, and most Gram-positive bacteria (|CITS: [10482527][3309561][9409150]|).  In both routes homocysteine is methylated to methionine via either a cobalamin-independent enzyme, or a cobalamin-dependent enzyme, depending upon the species or growth conditions |CITS: [12948640][9409150]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of methionine is an energy-costly process involving inputs from several other pathways.  The carbon skeleton of methionine is derived from aspartate (see pathway |FRAME: HOMOSERSYN-PWY |).  The sulfur is derived from cysteine (see pathway |FRAME: CYSTSYN-PWY|) which derives its sulfur from sulfate assimilation (see pathway |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|).  The methyl group is derived from serine via one-carbon metabolism (see pathways |FRAME: 1CMET2-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-2161|).  Methionine is also converted to <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine, a methyl group donor, by the product of gene <i>metK</i> (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6151|).  The main steps of methionine biosynthesis from homoserine are shown here.
/
/Homoserine is first activated by <i>O</i>-succinylation in a reaction catalyzed by MetA.  The product <i>O</i>-succinyl-L-homoserine combines with cysteine to form cystathionine in a reaction catalyzed by MetB.  Lyase cleavage of cystathionine by MetC forms homocysteine.  This &beta;-cystathionase activity can also be supplied by MalY as demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> by the ability of constitutive MalY expression to complement <i>metC</i> mutants auxotrophic for methionine |CITS: [7665481]|.  Homocysteine is subsequently methylated by either MetH or MetE to produce methionine.  In <i>E. coli</i> MetH can function only in the presence of exogenously supplied vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin), which represses MetE expression.  B<sub>12</sub> is likely to be available in the gut.  In the absence of exogenously supplied B<sub>12</sub>, MetE catalyzes this final step of <i>de novo</i> methionine biosynthesis.  Although the pathway is largely regulated at the transcriptional level, feedback inhibition of the first enzyme homoserine <i>O</i>-succinyltransferase (MetA) by methionine and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine has been shown.
/
/Under stressful conditions there is further regulation of the pathway enzymes.  Under heat-shock conditions growth is slowed due to the thermal instability of MetA.  Oxidative stress affects MetE which contains an oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue at position 645 near the active site.  Oxidation of methionone itself can also occur although the cell contains methionine sufloxide reductases MsrA and MsrB to combat this.  Weak organic acids also generate oxidative stress, with more complex effects.  Sulfur limitation depletes homocysteine which serves as a coactivator for MetR activation of MetE expression. 
/
/Due to the absence of this pathway in mammals, some of the bacterial biosynthetic enzymes are potential drug targets |CITS: [15155634]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In many bacteria including <i>Escherichia coli</i> |FRAME: Glycogens "glycogen"| is the primary carbon and energy storage compound. Evidence suggests that it may play a role in the long-term survival of the cell. In <i>E. coli</i> glycogen is stored in granules in the cytosol |CITS: [16816199]|. It is biosynthesized in a highly regulated manner when carbon is plentiful, but other nutrients are limiting (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|). Glycogen is utilized when carbon sources become limiting. The regulation of endogenous glycogen metabolism in <i>E. coli</i> remains incompletely understood |CITS: [17543954][19702577][20118147][21029047]| and has been the subject of metabolic modeling studies |CITS: [21421758][22750467]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> genes <i>glgP</i> and <i>glgX</i> are involved in glycogen degradation, whereas <i>glgA</i>, <i>glgB</i> and <i>glgC</i> are involved in glycogen biosynthesis. Earlier studies suggested that the <i>glg</i> genes for glycogen metabolism are clustered into two tandemly arranged operons, <i>glgBX</i> and <i>glgCAP</i>. However, more recent transcription studies in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 demonstrated that genes <i>glgBXCAP</i> are transcribed in a single transcriptional unit under the control of promoter sequences upstream of <i>glgB</i>. In addition, a promoter within <i>glgC</i> controls the expression of <i>glgA</i> and <i>glgP</i>. These transcription units are part of both the RelA and PhoP-PhoQ regulons |CITS: [21029047]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> cannot grow on exogenous |FRAME: Glycogens "glycogen"|, |FRAME: Starch|, or |FRAME: Pullulans|), although they are able to grow on linear &alpha;-1,4-linked |FRAME: Maltodextrins "maltodextrins"| ranging in size from maltose to maltodextrins of up to about 20 glucose units in length (in Mayer and Boos |CITS: [ecosal]|, see below).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>glgP</i> and <i>glgX</i> genes are involved in the initial breakdown of glycogen. During endogenous glycogen degradation, the glycogen phosphorylase product of gene <i>glgP</i> shortens the glycogen chains sequentially from their nonreducing end to produce a limit dextrin (also called a glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin). Overexpression of <i>glgP</i> can decrease glycogen to undetectable levels, and the lowering of glycogen levels directly correlates with increases in the expression of glycogen phosphorylase activity. The debranching enzyme product of <i>glgX</i> removes &alpha;-1,6-linked branches that are a maximum of four glucosyl residues in length to produce a debranched limit dextrin (also called a debranched glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin). It is therefore likely that GlgX releases maltotetraose from glycogen and also plays an important role in the production of maltotriose, an endogenous inducer of the maltose system (see below) |CITS: [16816199][15687211]|. 
/
/Further breakdown of the maltodextrin intermediates, maltotetraose, maltotriose and maltose involves the products of the maltose utilization genes <i>malP, malZ and malQ</i>. These genes are part of the maltose/maltodextrin regulon controlled by MalT, a transcriptional activator that is activated by maltotriose |CITS: [16321936][16816199][19028900]|. 
/
/Maltodextrin phosphorylase encoded by <i>malP</i> phosphorylytically cleaves glucosyl residues from the nonreducing end of maltodextrins producing &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate and a shortened maltodextrin. Maltotetraose is the smallest substrate, therefore the ultimate product of MalP action on a maltodextrin is the inducer maltotriose |CITS: [16816199][16321936]|. &alpha;-D-glucose 1-phosphate is converted to &alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase encoded by gene <i>pgm</i>. &alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate can spontaneously convert to its &beta; epimer and enter central metabolism as shown in the pathway link. 
/
/Maltodextrin glucosidase encoded by <i>malZ</i> can cleave &alpha;-D-glucose residues sequentially from the reducing end of maltodextrins, with the smallest substrate being maltotriose. In the case of maltotriose, the reaction products are &alpha;-D-glucose and maltose. The former compound is a source of glucose for the cell and can spontaneously epimerize to &beta;-D-glucose (|FRAME: ALDOSE-1-EPIMERASE-RXN|) and enter central metabolism as shown in the pathway link. Although MalZ is a maltodextrin-specific enzyme, its exact role is unclear and it is not essential for maltose or maltodextrin utilization |CITS: [16816199][19028900]|.
/
/Amylomaltase encoded by <i>malQ</i> is a 4-&alpha;-glucanotransferase that is essential for maltose degradation. MalQ mutants are unable to grow on maltose. Amylomaltase preferentially removes glucose from the reducing ends of maltose and small maltodextrins, transferring the enzyme-bound dextrinyl residue to the nonreducing ends of other maltodextrins, thereby forming longer maltodextrins (in |CITS: [21421758]|). In this process the number of glucosidic linkages remains constant. Therefore MalQ can both degrade and synthesize the inducer maltotriose, allowing induction when the bacteria are grown on maltodextrins |CITS: [16816199]|. The &beta;-D-glucose formed is phosphorylated by glucokinase and the resulting &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis.

COMMON-NAME - L-arginine biosynthesis I (via L-ornithine)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of L-arginine in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis and certain degradative pathways.  In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the L-arginine biosynthetic genes are scattered in several units of expression on the chromosome and are not strictly coordinated.  Synthesis of the L-arginine biosynthetic enzymes is repressed by L-arginine under control of the arginine repressor encoded by the <i>argR</i> gene, forming the arginine regulon |CITS: [17074904][14168690]|.  In stationary phase cultures, positive control by RpoS is also required for full control of arginine biosynthesis |CITS: [16504055]|.  The initial steps in the L-arginine biosynthesis pathway proceed via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates to L-ornithine, as shown here and in pathway |FRAME: GLUTORN-PWY|.  The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the spontaneous cyclization of L-glutamate derivatives, which leads to L-proline biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PROSYN-PWY|) thus keeping the pathways leading to L-arginine and L-proline separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein).
/
/In microorganisms two alternative pathways have evolved that differ in the way the key intermediate <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another key intermediate, <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine.  In this pathway, which is less common but found in the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed by <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate synthase and <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, forming L-ornithine and acetate.  In the other pathway which is found in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine is recycled onto L-glutamate, regenerating <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate (see |FRAME: ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|).  In a third pathway found in several eubacteria <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine is transcarbamylated directly to <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-citrulline, followed by deacetylation to L-citrulline (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5154|) (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway L-glutamate is acetylated to the key intermediate <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate by the enzyme <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate synthase, encoded by the <i>argA</i> gene. The acetyl donor for this reaction is acetyl-CoA.  <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate is then converted in three enzymatic steps to a second key intermediate, <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine.  In the fifth step the acetyl group is then hydrolytically removed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase encoded by the <i>argE</i> gene, producing acetate and the L-arginine precursor L-ornithine.  L-ornithine is combined with carbamoyl-phosphate to form L-citrulline, which is converted in two steps to L-arginine.  Carbamoyl-phosphate is also a precursor in <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|).  
/
/The last three steps complete the assembly of the guanidino group of L-arginine from carbamoyl-phosphate and the amino group of L-aspartate.  Pathway enzyme regulation occurs via L-arginine feedback inhibition of <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate synthase, and via allosteric activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase by L-ornithine.  Allosteric inhibition of this enzyme by uridine 5'-phosphate balances the distribution of carbamoyl-phosphate in the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways.  A molecular kinetic model for arginine biosynthesis in <i>E. coli</i> that was supported by experimental measurements has been developed.  The model took into account the complex genetic and metabolic regulatory network including <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine biosynthesis |CITS: [18165237]|].
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> L-arginine is not only utilized in protein synthesis, but also as a precursor for the polyamines putrescine and subsequently spermidine (see |FRAME: PWY-40| and the pathway link).  This putrescine pathway is used when L-arginine concentrations are high enough to inhibit L-ornithine synthesis, which prevents the conversion of L-ornithine to putrescine (as in |FRAME: PWY-46|) (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).

COMMON-NAME - pentose phosphate pathway
COMMENT - The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of <i>E. coli</i>'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): D-ribose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which <i>E. coli</i> is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.  In addition, this pathway is an important source of reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, glucose-6-phosphate, and ends with the formation of two others, fructose-6-phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY "oxidative portion"|, in which glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to ribulose-5-phosphate, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which, through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes of <i>E. coli</i> convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and CO<sub>2</sub>. These large, multienzyme complexes include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) (see |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|) and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC, shown here).  They consist of three enzyme components, a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). Components E1 and E2 are unique to each enzyme, while component E3 is functionally interchangeable between the two complexes |CITS: [6311808]|. E3 also functions in the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY|.
/
/The <i>E. coli</i> K-12 |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 12, 24, and 2 units of the E1(o), E2(o), and E3 components, respectively whereas the |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1(p), E2(p), and E3 components, respectively. In both <i>E. coli</i> enzymes the octahedral core of the complex is made up of 24 E2 units which contain lipoyllysine and binding sites for dimers of the other two subunits which are flexibly tethered to the E2 core |CITS: [16338405]|. The three subunits of the <i>E. coli</i> OGDHC are a |FRAME: E1O| E1(o) encoded by <i>sucA</i>, a |FRAME: E2O| E2(o) encoded by <i>sucB</i>, and the |FRAME: E3-CPLX| E3 encoded by <i>lpd</i> (synonym <i>lpdA</i>).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway illustrated here shows the reactions catalyzed by the |FRAME:2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX|, a key, rate-limiting enzyme of the |FRAME: TCA|. These reactions can be summarized by the general reaction |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-RXN| which is the form commonly found in the TCA cycle. 
/
/During the OGDHC reaction cycle, 2-oxoglutarate is bound and decarboxylated by E1(o), a thiamin-diphosphate cofactor containing enzyme. The succinyl group is transferred to the lipoyl domain of E2(o) where it is carried to the active site and transferred to coenzyme A, forming succinyl-CoA. During this transfer the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. The succinyl-CoA is released and the lipoyl domain of E2(o) is oxidized by E3 via transfer of protons to NAD, forming NADH and regenerating the lipoyl group back to lipoyllysine for another cycle |CITS: [16338405]|.
/
/Under aerobic growth conditions the OGDHC not only catalyzes a key reaction in the TCA cycle, it also provides succinyl-CoA for methionine and lysine biosynthesis (see pathways |FRAME: HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|), the latter pathway also leading to peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The synthesis of the OGDHC is repressed by anaerobiosis and is also subject to glucose repression. It is induced by aerobic growth on acetate |CITS: [6311808][5319784]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| is a common product of purine degradation.  |FRAME: ECOLI| is able to utilize |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as a sole source of nitrogen under anaerobic conditions, but can not utilize it as a sole source of carbon |CITS: [10601204]|.
/
/The first step in allantoin degradation is the opening of the aromatic ring, yielding |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|, performed by |FRAME: CPLX-64|.  In the next step allantoate is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: CPD0-2298| by |FRAME: CPLX-7524|.  While the second hydrolysis step (from |FRAME: CPD0-2298| to |FRAME: CPD-1091|) can happen spontaneously in a non-stereospecific manner, it is stereospecifically catalyzed by |FRAME: G6284-MONOMER|.
/
/|FRAME: G6286-MONOMER| then oxidizes ureidoglycolate to |FRAME: CPD-389|.  While not proven unequivocally in <i>E. coli</i>, it is believed |FRAME: CPD-389| is converted into |FRAME: OXAMATE| and |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which can be further metabolized to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|, |FRAME: AMMONIA| and ATP |CITS: [10601204]|.
/
/The variant pathway |FRAME: PWY-5705| shows a possible alternative route of allantoin degradation, where the ureidoglycolate intermediate is processed differently.  The enzyme |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| can convert ureidoglycolate to |FRAME: GLYOX| and |FRAME: UREA|; glyoxylate could then enter general metabolism, where it would be converted by the successive action of three enzymes to 3-phosphoglycerate, feeding into |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS| (see |FRAME: GLYCOLATEMET-PWY|).  However, this route would imply that allantoin <b>can</b> serve as a sole source of carbon in <i>E. coli</i>, which it can not.  Additionally, |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| is poorly characterized.

CITATIONS - 3897227:EV-EXP-IDA:3617911090:amackie
COMMENT - This pathway is one of three by which pyruvate, largely derived from glycolysis, is cleaved.  Under conditions of aerobic growth, most pyruvate is cleaved by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [see Pathway: |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|] to CO<sub>2</sub> and acetyl-CoA.  Anaerobically it is cleaved via pyruvate formate lyase (see Pathway: |FRAME: FERMENTATION-PWY|).  The physiological role of this third (PoxB) route, which yields acetate and CO<sub>2</sub>, is mysterious because it yields acetate rather than acetyl-CoA and is, therefore, energetically wasteful.  However, the pathway does play some useful metabolic role because mutant strains lacking PoxB activity grow more slowly and yield a lesser crop of cells |CITS: [11390679]|.  PoxB expression, under the control of RpoS, is increased as cultures enter stationary phase.  Greater quantities of acetate accumulate and the ace (acetate conversion to acetyl-CoA) pathway is induced. Perhaps this pathway functions as a "safety valve" to maintain acetyl-CoA at optimum intracellular levels.

COMMENT - In the respiratory chain formed by NADH dehydrogenase I (NDH-I) and cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase the transfer of electrons from NADH to oxygen is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane.  By analogy to the related enzyme from mitochondria, NDH-I is thought to function as a proton pump translocating 4H<sup>+</sup> per NADH oxidised (2e<sup>-</sup>) [H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 2] however a lower ratio of 3H<sup>+</sup>/2e<sup>-</sup> has also been proposed |CITS: [8892824], [22392981]|. Cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase translocates 1 H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> by means of an oriented redox loop |CITS: [1850294]|.
/
/During glucose limited aerobic growth <i>E. coli</i> directs electron flux through both |FRAME: NADH-DHII-MONOMER "NADH dehydrogenase II"| (NDH-II) and NDH-I |CITS: [8491720]|. Electron transport from NADH to oxygen is not affected in a strain lacking NDH-I but is significantly reduced in a strain lacking NDH-II which suggests that NDH-II is used preferentially in aerobic respiration |CITS: [9063459]|.
/
/Cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase is expressed under oxygen-limiting conditions |CITS: [2172211], [8576043]| unlike cytochrome <i>bo</i> oxidase which is expressed when oxygen levels are high |CITS: [6365921]|. <i>E. coli</i> K-12 also contains a second <i>bd</i>-type cytochrome (|FRAME: APP-UBIOX-CPLX|) encoded by the <i>appBC</i> genes. The physiological role of cytochrome <i>bd</i>-II is uncertain although it is able to generate PMF via a mechanism similar to cytochrome <i>bd</i>-I |CITS: [21987791]|.

COMMON-NAME - biotin biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - 20693992:EV-EXP-IDA:3491158936:caspi
COMMENT - |FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is an essential cofactor for carboxyl group transfer enzymes such as |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, and is required by all forms of life |CITS: [ColiSalII]|. 
/
/Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years.  The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [20693992]|.
/
/Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure.  The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, describe the synthesis of the precursor of the pimelate moiety.  The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.
/
/The origins of the biotin carbon atoms in <i>E. coli</i> are known from <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis of products labeled <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [8125118][Indrajit94]|.  The C3, C5 and C7 carbons are derived from carbon C1 of acetate, while the C2, C4 and C6 carbons are derived from carbon C2 of acetate.  The C1 carbon originates from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|.  This labeling pattern indicated that the pimeloyl moiety of biotin is formed by head-to-tail incorporation of three intact acetate units, similar to the synthesis of fatty acids |CITS: [Indrajit94]|.  As the biotin C1 and C7 atoms show different labeling patterns, free pimelic acid (a symmetrical molecule) could not be an intermediate, and thus it has been assumed that |FRAME: CPD-558| is the precursor |CITS: [Webb07]|.
/
/The elucidation of the pathway proved difficult, mostly since only two genes, |FRAME: EG10119| and |FRAME: EG10122|, were implicated in the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety |CITS: [4563978][8830257][4877129]|.  Based on these finding, there have been several suggestions that enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are involved, although none of these suggestions could explain the full process |CITS: [Indrajit94][13930373]|.  An inclusive model was finally suggested in 2010 |CITS: [20693992]| and later refined.  Based on this model, |FRAME: EG10119 "BioC"| converts the free carboxyl group of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| to its methyl ester by transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| |CITS: [22965231]|.  The newly acquired methyl group mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains, and enables the esterified |FRAME: Malonyl-acp-methyl-ester| to enter the fatty acid synthetic pathway.
/
/Two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) produce |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACP-methyl-esters "pimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester"|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG10122 "BioH"| to give |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs "pimeloyl-[acp]"|.  The [acp] protein is then removed in a complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EG10121 "BioF"|, forming |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, the first intermediate in biotin ring assembly.
/
/The next step in the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: DAPASYN-CPLX| |CITS: [1092681][1092682][12379100]|.  The product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|.  This enzyme catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.
/
/The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|.  This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction.  It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i>, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|.  However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.
/
/According to this model, the introduction of the methyl ester early in the pathway disguises the biotin synthetic intermediates so that they become substrates for the fatty acid synthetic pathway.  When the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety is complete and disguise is no longer needed, the methyl group is removed to free the carboxyl group that will eventually be used to attach biotin to its target metabolic enzymes.
/
/An <i>in vitro</i> system that uses dialyzed cell extracts was used in combination with several mutant strains and purified proteins to verify the proposed pathway |CITS: [20693992]|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of hexitol degradation (bacteria)
COMMENT - Of the ten existing hexitols (|FRAME: CPD-15703|, |FRAME: CPD-12811|, |FRAME: CPD-15702|, |FRAME: SORBITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-12810|, |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-15701|, |FRAME: CPD-357|, |FRAME: CPD-369| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL|) only three occur naturally - |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: SORBITOL| (also known as D-glucitol), and |FRAME: GALACTITOL| (owing to symmetry, D- and L-galactitol are identical). |FRAME: MANNITOL| is the most abundant polyol in nature, and is found in bacteria, fungi, algae, lichens and vascular plants.
/
/All three naturally-occurring hexitols can be utilized by bacteria as a total source of carbon and energy.
/Each of these hexitols enters the cell via a specific phosphotransferase system, so the first intracellular species is the 6-phospho-derivative |CITS: [1100608]|. Note that due to symmetry of |FRAME: MANNITOL| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL|, their phosphorylation at either end produces the same molecule. When these molecules are phosphorylated at the 6 position by the PTS system, the resulting molecules are named |FRAME: MANNITOL-1P| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL-1-PHOSPHATE|, respectively, by conventional nomenclature rules.
/
/In all three cases this sugar alcohol phosphate becomes the substrate for a dehydrogenase that oxidizes its 2-alcohol group to a keto group. In the cases of |FRAME: MANNITOL| and |FRAME: SORBITOL|, the resulting keto sugar phosphate is |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|, an intermediate of glycolysis, and hence it flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy |CITS: [6384188][2111176]|.
/
/In the case of |FRAME: GALACTITOL-1-PHOSPHATE|, however, the product of the dehydrogenation is |FRAME: TAGATOSE-6-PHOSPHATE|, which becomes the substrate of a kinase and subsequently an aldolase (in a pair of reactions that parallel those of glycolysis) before it is converted into intermediates (|FRAME: GAP| and
/|FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|) of glycolysis |CITS: [8955298]|.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> makes four polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, cadaverine, and aminopropylcadaverine,
/the syntheses of which are shown here. 
/These positively charged di-cations are essential for normal growth, probably for a number of reasons
/including, neutralizing charges on nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, stimulating certain enzymes and
/balancing intracellular osmotic versus ionic strength.  There is some evidence that cadaverine, the
/decarboxylation product of lysine, and aminopropylcadaverine can substitute for putrescine and spermidine. 
/In the absence of exogenous
/arginine, the principal flow to putrescine and hence spermidine is via ornithine decarboxylase.  In the
/presence of exogenous arginine, however, when ornithine biosynthesis is halted by repression and
/feed-back inhibition, biosynthesis of putrescine occurs in two steps from arginine 1) by arginine
/decarboxylase (which is located in the periplasm so that the arginine that flows into polyamines never
/mixes with the intracellular pool of that amino acid) and then 2) by agmatinase which produces urea along
/with putrescine--the only urea-producing reaction in <i>E. coli</i>.

COMMENT - This pathway shows the generation of acetoacetyl-ACP which feeds in to the pathway of elongation of saturated 
/fatty acids.
/
/The cycles of elongation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid involve the same reactions. The branch from the 
/saturated to the unsaturated pathway occurs when the chain length is 10 carbon atoms.
/
/The pathway of elongation of saturated fatty shows the reactions that constitute one turn of a cycle that lengthens 
/the chain of an acyl-ACP molecule by two carbons. The products of multiple turns 
/of this cycle that are drawn off to become components of fatty acid-containing compounds such as phospholipids, 
/lipid A, and lipoproteins are the saturated fatty acids , lauric (dodecanoic), myristic (tetradecanoic), palmitic 
/(hexadecanoic), and stearic (octadecanoic) acids. <i>E. coli </i> also contains unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed 
/by a pathway (Pathway: fatty acid elongation -- unsaturated) that branches at the level of the 10-carbon 
/intermediate. |CITS: [14527277], [8246839]|. The final step of the cycle, the reductase, once thought to be 
/catalyzed by two enzymes, has been shown to be catalyzed by a single enzyme, FabI, that can use either NADH or 
/NADPH as a substrate |CITS: [9022698]|.
/
/Of the four reactions involved in a cycle of fatty-acid elongation, two are catalyzed by more that one enzyme. These

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Curcumin and other curcuminoids are plant secondary metabolites produced by <i>Curcuma longa</i> (turmeric) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-6432|).  Curcumin is the main yellow pigment of turmeric which is used as a spice and a pigment.  In addition, curcumin has a range of medicinal properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and analgesic.  Curcumin metabolism has been studied in humans and rodents and the production of reduced dihydro-, tetrahydro-, hexahydro- and octahydrocurcumin derivatives has been identified, with tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin being the major products.  These reduced curcumin derivatives may then be conjugated to form glucuronides, sulfates, or mixed glucuronides/sulfates.  However, the mammalian enzymes and their encoding genes responsible for production of the reduced curcumin derivatives have not been identified.  Tetrahydrocurcumin has been shown to have more potent antioxidative activity than curcumin (in |CITS: [21467222]| and reviewed in |CITS: [17569222]|).
/
/Intestinal microorganisms have also been shown to metabolize curcumin.  Curcumin metabolizing microorganisms were found in samples of human feces and the organism with the highest curcumin converting activity was isolated, cultured and identified as <i>Escherichia coli</i>.  High curcumin converting activity was also identified in <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 substr. DH10B whose genome sequence has been determined.  The curcumin metabolizing enzyme was purified from extracts of this organism and used to identify its encoding gene.  Following gene cloning and overexpression, the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized.  The results showed that <i>E. coli</i> gene <i>yncB</i> (annotated as predicted oxidoreductase, Zn-dependent and NAD(P)-binding) encoded the curcumin-converting enzyme and it was renamed <i>curA</i> |CITS: [21467222]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b> 
/
/The purified product of <i>Escherichia coli</i> gene <i>curA</i> was shown to catalyze the NADPH-dependent, sequential reduction of curcumin first to the stable intermediate dihydrocurcumin, and then to the final end product tetrahydrocurcumin.  These compounds were identified by mass spectrometry techniques.  How curcumin enters the <i>E. coli</i> cell and the fate of tetrahydrocurcumin in <i>E. coli</i> is not yet known.  However, the optimum culture conditions for curcumin-converting enzyme formation in <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 substr. DH10B included the use of 0.03% curcumin as the sole carbon source and 0.3% yeast extract as nitrogen source, suggesting further metabolism of curcumin under these conditions.  It has also been speculated that tetrahydrocurcumin produced by human or animal gut microorganisms may be used for various activities in the body |CITS: [21467222]|.

The physiological role of cytochrome <i>bd</i>-II is uncertain although it is able to generate PMF via a mechanism similar to cytochrome <i>bd</i>-I |CITS: [21987791]|. The expression of succinate dehydrogenase is maximal during aerobic growth; repression under anaerobiosis is mediated by the global regulators ArcA and Fnr (reviewed in |CITS: [7855430]|).

COMMON-NAME - pyruvate to cytochrome <i>bd</i> terminal oxidase electron transfer
CITATIONS - 6367818:EV-EXP-IDA:3617910882:amackie
COMMENT - This pathway is one of three by which pyruvate, largely derived from glycolysis, is cleaved.  Under conditions of aerobic growth, most pyruvate is cleaved by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [see Pathway: |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|] to CO<sub>2</sub> and acetyl-CoA.  Anaerobically it is cleaved via pyruvate formate lyase (see Pathway: |FRAME: FERMENTATION-PWY|).  The physiological role of this third (PoxB) route, which yields acetate and CO<sub>2</sub>, is mysterious because it yields acetate rather than acetyl-CoA and is, therefore, energetically wasteful.  However, the pathway does play some useful metabolic role because mutant strains lacking PoxB activity grow more slowly and yield a lesser crop of cells |CITS: [11390679]|.  PoxB expression, under the control of RpoS, is increased as cultures enter stationary phase.  Greater quantities of acetate accumulate and the ace (acetate conversion to acetyl-CoA) pathway is induced. Perhaps this pathway functions as a "safety valve" to maintain acetyl-CoA at optimum intracellular levels.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are unique and complex glycolipids that provide characteristic components of the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Wild type LPS is composed of a hydrophobic domain lipid A (or endotoxin), a phosphorylated "core" oligosaccharide (core OS) and a distal O-specific polysaccharide (or O-antigen). Strains of <I>E. coli</I> K-12 normally do not make O-antigen, unless a mutation in the O-antigen operon is corrected |CITS: [7517391]|. O antigens are not needed for growth in the laboratory, but they protect bacteria from antibiotics and complement-mediated lysis. The lipid A and Kdo domains of LPS are required for growth |CITS: [17362200][12045108]|. 
/
/The lipid A (endotoxin) domain of LPS is a unique, glucosamine-based saccharolipid that serves as the hydrophobic anchor of LPS. It is the bioactive component of the molecule that is associated with gram-negative septic shock |CITS: [15052329]|. There are approximately 10<sup>6</sup> lipid A residues in an <i>E. coli</i> cell |CITS: [17362200]|. Lipid A of <i>E. coli</i> consists of a &beta; (1'->6)-linked D-glucosamine disaccharide that carries four (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl groups in positions 2, 3, 2', and 3' and two phosphoryl residues in positions 1 and 4'. The hydroxy fatty acids at positions 2' and 3' are acylated at their 3-hydroxyl groups by dodecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid, respectively |CITS: [3317748]|. Given their conserved architecture, most types of lipid A molecules are detected at picomolar levels by TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) of the innate immune system present on macrophages and endothelial cells of animals |CITS: [12045108]|.
/
/The core oligosaccharides are conceptually divided into two regions: the inner core (lipid A proximal) and the outer core. The inner core is highly conserved. It comprises three 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) residues and it is often phosphorylated. Structural diversity in the core oligosaccharide is limited by the constraints imposed by its essential role in outer membrane stability |CITS: [12935355][9791168]|. <i>E. coli</i> mutants that lack the heptose region of the inner core display the "deep rough" phenotype characterized by changes in both the structure and the composition of the outer membrane leading to its instability |CITS: [385128]|. Deep rough mutants of <i>E. coli</i> activate expression of colanic acid exopolysaccharide, lose expression of pili and flagella and secrete a form of hemolysin with reduced hemolytic activity |CITS: [1348243]|. The outer core comprises a tri-hexose backbone modified with varying side-branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues. The outer core region provides an attachment site for O antigen |CITS: [9791168]|. Mutations that eliminate synthesis of the outer core result in increased susceptibility to some hydrophobic compounds due to an indirect effect on core phosphorylation |CITS: [2168379]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> lipid A is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane by a conserved pathway of nine constitutive enzymes. The first reaction of lipid A biosynthesis is the acylation of the sugar nucleotide UDP-GlcNAc by LpxA. Deacetylation of the product, UDP-3-O-(acyl)-GlcNAc by the zinc metalloenzyme LpxC is the committed reaction of the pathway. LpxC is an excellent target for the design of novel, gram-negative specific antibiotics. Following deacetylation, a second beta-hydroxymyristate moiety is incorporated by LpxD to generate UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine. UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine is cleaved at its pyrophosphate bond by the highly selective pyrophosphatase LpxH to form 2,3-diacylglucosamine-1-phosphate (lipid X). A beta,1'-6 linked disaccharide is then generated by the condensation of another molecule of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine with lipid X by LpxB. A specific kinase, LpxK next phosphorylates the 4' position of the disaccharide to form lipid IVA. The kinase product, lipid IVA, is of great interest because it possesses some of the properties of endotoxins |CITS: [12045108]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> LPS contains two Kdo residues that are transferred to lipid IVA by a bifunctional enzyme, encoded by <i>waaA</i>. The chromosomal waa region (formerly rfa) contains the major core-oligosaccharide assembly operons, and <i>E. coli</i> K-12 provided the first waa region sequenced in its entirety |CITS: [12935355]|. The last steps of <i>E. coli</i> lipid A biosynthesis involve the addition of lauroyl and myristoyl residues to the distal glucosamine unit (generating acyloxyacyl moieties by LpxL and LpxM respectively. The completed lipid A-Kdo2 serves as the acceptor on which the core oligosaccharide and lipo-oligosaccharide chains are assembled. 
/
/The lipid A-core portion (known as rough LPS (R-LPS)) is synthesized by a conserved pathway. The mechanism involves sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors with a co-coordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases (Waa proteins) acting at the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane (IM). The modification of the core region of <i>E. coli</i> LPS requires the action of three enzymes, <i>viz.</i> WaaP (an LPS kinase), WaaY (an enzyme required for a second phosphorylation) and WaaQ (a transferase that adds the side-branch heptose). The WaaP enzyme is the most important of these activities since the modifications must proceed in the strict order WaaPQY. Mutants lacking WaaP activity exhibit the deep rough phenotype and are avirulent. Mutant LPSs lacking the outer core (<i>waaG</i>) are phosphorylated inefficiently by WaaP |CITS: [10986272]|. Conversely, the loss of phosphorylation results in a decreased efficiency of core extension, leading to more truncated cores than seen in the wild type. 
/
/The lipid A-core is then flipped to the outer surface of the inner membrane by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, MsbA. An additional integral membrane protein, YhjD, has recently been implicated in LPS export across the IM. The smallest LPS derivative that supports viability in <i>E. coli</i> is lipid IVA. However, it requires mutations in either MsbA or YhjD, to suppress the normally lethal consequence of an incomplete lipid A |CITS: [18480051]|. Recent studies with deletion mutants implicate the periplasmic protein LptA, the cytosolic protein LptB, and the IM proteins LptC, LptF, and LptG in the subsequent transport of nascent LPS to the outer membrane (OM), where the LptD/LptE complex flips LPS to the outer surface |CITS: [18768814]|.
/
/This topic has been reviewed in |CITS: [17362200][15052329][12935355][12045108][9791168][9157235][8330896][2663021][3317748][2446369]|.

COMMENT - In the respiratory chain formed by NADH dehydrogenase II (NDH-II) and cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase the transfer of electrons from NADH to oxygen is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. NDH-II does not contribute to the generation of proton potential |CITS: [3122832], [2679883]|; cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase translocates 1 H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> by means of an oriented redox loop |CITS: [1850294]|.
/
/During glucose limited aerobic growth <i>E. coli</i> directs electron flux through both |FRAME: NADH-DHI-CPLX "NADH dehydrogenase I"| (NDH-I) and NDH-II |CITS: [8491720]|. Electron transport from NADH to oxygen is not affected in a strain lacking NDH-I but is significantly reduced in a strain lacking NDH-II; similarly nitrate respiration with NADH was only slightly affected in a strain lacking NDH-I but significantly reduced in a strain lacking NDH-II. This suggests that NDH-II is used preferentially in aerobic and nitrate respiration |CITS: [9063459]|.
/
/Cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase is expressed under oxygen-limiting conditions |CITS: [2172211], [8576043]| unlike cytochrome <i>bo</i> oxidase which is expressed when oxygen levels are high |CITS: [6365921]|. <i>E. coli</i> K-12 also contains a second <i>bd</i>-type cytochrome (|FRAME: APP-UBIOX-CPLX|) encoded by the <i>appBC</i> genes. The physiological role of cytochrome <i>bd</i>-II is uncertain although it is able to generate PMF via a mechanism similar to cytochrome <i>bd</i>-I |CITS: [21987791]|.

COMMON-NAME - hydrogen to trimethylamine N-oxide electron transfer
CITATIONS - 2204318:EV-EXP-IDA:3634260935:amackie
COMMENT - Hydrogen dependent reduction of trimethyamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been described in <i>E. coli</i> K-10 |CITS: [363703]| and in the K-12 derived sub-strain AN387 |CITS: [2204318]|. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 contains two membrane bound, H(2) uptake hydrogenases - |FRAME: FORMHYDROGI-CPLX "hydrogenase 1"| (Hyd1) and hydrogenase 2 (Hyd 2). Hyd 2 is a standard O<sub>2</sub> sensitive hydrogenase and is the major hydrogenase during anaerobic respiration with hydrogen and fumarate |CITS: [3905769] [11506918]| while Hyd 1 is an O<sub>2</sub> tolerant hydrogenase whose physiological function is not yet clearly defined (see for example |CITS: [24715724][23260654]|.
/
/<I>E. coli</i> K-12 also contains two TMAO reductases: the inducible enzyme encoded by <i>torCA</i> (shown in this pathway), and a second TMAO reductase encoded by |FRAME: CPLX-63 "<i>torYZ</i>"| which has low constitutive expression and is not induced by TMAO or dimethyl sulfoxide |CITS: [11004177]|. 
/
/TMAO reductase does not contribute to proton potential (see review by |CITS: [18930017]|). Hyd 2 is presumed to be an energy conserving enzyme (see |CITS: [9230919]|). H2-dependent reduction of the quinol analogs, menadione and ubiquinone-1, in <i>E. coli</i> spheroplasts is coupled to a protonophore-sensitive, proton translocation with H+/2e- stoichiometry of approx. 2 |CITS: [6249272]|. Both menaquinone (shown here) and demethylmenaquinone can operate in hydrogen to TMAO respiration |CITS: [2204318][1444716]|.

COMMON-NAME - anhydromuropeptides recycling
CITATIONS - 16452451:EV-EXP:3433000853:keseler
COMMENT - Anhydromuropeptides (mainly |FRAME: CPD0-1080|) are steadily released during growth by lytic transglycosylases and endopeptidases and imported back into the cytoplasm for recycling. During bacterial growth, a very large proportion of the peptidoglycan polymer is degraded and reused in a process termed cell wall recycling. For example, the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562| recovers about half of its cell wall within one generation |CITS: [18535144][23163477]|.
/
/The anhydromuropeptides are imported by the |FRAME: EG12183|-encoded |FRAME: AMPG-MONOMER|. Once inside the cytoplasm, the anhydromuropeptides are hydrolyzed by |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.28| (|FRAME: EG10041|), |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.52| (|FRAME: G6567|) and |FRAME: G6621-MONOMER| (|FRAME: G6621|), yielding |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: CPD0-882|, |FRAME: L-ALA-GAMMA-D-GLU-DAP| and |FRAME: D-ALANINE| |CITS: [    3891732]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD0-882| is phosphorylated by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.170| (|FRAME: G6880|) and then converted into |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P| by |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.126| (|FRAME: G7263|). This is a branch point, as this compound could be directed either for further degradation (see pathways of |FRAME: N-Acetylglucosamine-Degradation|) or for recycling into new peptidoglycan monomers, as described in this pathway |CITS: [15901686][15983044]|.
/The final product of this pathway, |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYLMURAMATE|, is one of the precursors for peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
/
/The tripeptide |FRAME: L-ALA-GAMMA-D-GLU-DAP|, which is generated by |FRAME: EC-3.4.17.13|, can be degraded further, as described in |FRAME: PWY0-1546|. However, the vast majority is recycled by muropeptide ligase (|FRAME: EG12440|). This enzyme is a dedicated recycling enzyme that attaches the recovered Ala-Glu-DAP tripeptide to |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYLMURAMATE|, thereby substituting three amino acid ligases of the peptidoglycan <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [8808921]|.
/
/Although exogenously provided |FRAME: CPD0-882| can be taken up by |FRAME:TAX-562|, it can not serve as the sole source of carbon for growth, suggesting that it may be toxic to the cell |CITS: [16452451]|.

COMMENT - In the anaerobic respiratory chain formed by NADH dehydrogenase I (NDH-1) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase the transfer of electrons from NADH to DMSO is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. 
/
/Anaerobic respiration on DMSO is coupled to the formation of a proton gradient |CITS: [2989249]|. Anaerobic growth of <i>E. coli</i> with DMSO operates preferentially with NDH-I |CITS: [9063459]|. By analogy to the related enzyme from mitochondria, NDH-I is thought to function as a proton pump translocating 4H<sup>+</sup> per NADH oxidised (2e<sup>-</sup>) [H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 2] however a lower ratio of 3H<sup>+</sup>/2e<sup>-</sup> has also been proposed |CITS: [8892824], [22392981]|. DMSO reductase does not contribute to proton potential and thus proton pumping by NDH-I is the only mechanism for proton motive force (PMF) generation in anaerobic NADH &rarr; DMSO respiration |CITS: [8892824] [9063459]|. Menaquinone serves as the redox mediator during anaerobic respiration with DMSO |CITS: [2204318]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Iron is an essential trace element. In the presence of oxygen, ferrous iron is oxidized to ferric iron which forms insoluble compounds, and is thus not available to organisms.
/As a result, the level of physiologically available iron can drop to far below 1 &mu;M, and become growth-limiting for bacteria. To survive, many bacteria evolved specialized transport systems called siderophores, which can complex and retract ferric iron ions.
/The siderophores are low molecular mass compounds, and have been generally divided into three main types: catecholate-, hydroxamate-, and carboxylate-siderophores.
/
/The siderophores, which have a very high and specific affinity for |FRAME: FE+3|, are excreted out of the cell and bind the metal extracellularly. The siderophore-metal complex is transported back into the cell through specific binding proteins present in the bacterial membrane.
/In Gram-negative bacteria, the binding protein transports the ferric-siderophore into the periplasm, where a second transporter transports it into the cytosol |CITS: [12196166]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN Enterobactin| is a catecholate siderophore produced almost exclusively by enterobacteria
/|CITS:[4908639][4908541][3067977]|, although it has been reported in some Streptomyces species |CITS:[11267771]|.
/It is a cyclic compound made of three units of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine joined in a cyclic structure by lactone linkages (only the &delta;-cis isomer of the ferric chelate is biologically active). Not only the cyclic molecule, but also the biosynthetic precursor 2,3-dihydroxy-N-benzoylserine and its linear dimer and trimer condensation products are able to transport iron into enterobacteria |CITS: [2139424][1831634]|.
/
/Enterobactin is synthesized under iron-deficient conditions and excreted into the environment where it binds Fe(III) with high affinity and specificity. The ferrisiderophore complexes are taken up into the cell by specific transport components.
/Enterobactin synthesis is divided into two parts:
/
/1) the conversion of |FRAME: CHORISMATE| to |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|
/
/2) the synthesis of enterobactin from |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| and |FRAME:SER|.
/
/The second part of the pathway can be summarized in a single reactiom (|FRAME: EC-6.3.2.14|):
/
/|FRAME:ENTMULTI-RXN|
/
/However, it is a rather complex process catalyzed by the different components of the non-ribosomal peptide synthase |FRAME: ENTMULTI-CPLX|. The process starts with the activation of |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: ENTE-CPLX|, encoded by |FRAME:EG10263| |CITS: [2531000]| in the following reaction
/
/|FRAME: DHBAMPLIG-RXN|
/
/The product is transferred onto the aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) domain of the entB bi-functional protein |CITS: [2139796][9214294]|, where it is attached to the free thiol group of its cofactor, |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P|. The cofactor attachment is catalyzed by the |FRAME: ENTD-MONOMER| protein (EntD).
/
/|FRAME: SER| is activated in a similar manner by the four-domain protein |FRAME: ENTF-PANT EntF|, and then bound to the peptidyl-carrier protein domain of this protein. 
/
/A different domain of EntF catalyzes the condensation of the activated serine and the activated 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate |CITS: [9485415][1826089]|, and then transfers the |FRAME: N-23-DIHYDROXYBENZOYL-L-SERINE| to the fourth domain of EntF, named the Te domain, which is responsible for the trimerization of three such moieties and the release of the trilactone |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN| |CITS: [10375542]|.

COMMENT - The presence of an anaerobic respiratory chain comprising periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 is supported by studies using isogenic strains with combinations of null lesions encompassing the periplasmic and membrane associated nitrate reductases (Nap, |FRAME: NITRATREDUCTA-CPLX "NRA"| and |FRAME: NITRATREDUCTZ-CPLX "NRZ"|). These studies indicate that <i>E. coli</i> can use periplasmic nitrate reductase and fumarate reductase equally well in a respiratory chain with glycerol-3-phosphate as electron donor |CITS: [11844760]|. A strain expressing only Nap (lacking NRA and NRZ) is preferentially selected during continuous anaerobic growth with glycerol under nitrate limiting conditions |CITS: [10548536]|
/
/Nap is preferentially expressed at low nitrate concentration - conditions under which it may be economical for the cell to reduce nitrate in the periplasm and make nitrite directly available to the energy conserving periplasmic nitrite reductase |CITS: [10464201][11844760]|. Nap can accept electrons from either ubiquinone (shown in this pathway) or menaquinone |CITS: [9325429]|. Nap couples more effectively to menaquinone oxidation; electron transfer from ubiquinol to NapAB requires the iron-sulfur proteins NapGH while electron transfer from menaquinol does not |CITS: [11967083]|

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3374939296:keseler
COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can use all three naturally occurring pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides (deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, and
/thymidine) as total sources of carbon and energy.  Deoxyuridine and thymidine are cleaved by a specific
/phosphorylase, yielding a pyrimidine base and D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate, which is converted to
/D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that also can utilize D-ribose-1-phosphate as a substrate.  A specific
/aldolase splits D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, yielding D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which enters central
/metabolism through the glycolytic pathway, and acetaldehyde, which must be converted to acetyl-CoA before it can
/enter central metabolism.  It does so via the TCA cycle.  In contrast, <i>E. coli</i> lacks a specific phosphorylase
/capable of cleaving deoxycytidine.  This nucleoside must be deaminated (thereby yielding deoxyuridine) before it can
/be cleaved.
/
/Although <i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize the deoxyribose moiety of deoxyribonucleosides, it is unable to utilize
/exogenously supplied deoxyribose; however, the closely related organism <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> can.
/
/The amino nitrogen of cytidine but not the ring-nitrogen of uracil or thymine, generated as by-products of this
/pathway, can serve as a total nitrogen source for <i>E. coli</i> over its entire temperature range of growth.  However,
/these ring nitrogens do become available to serve as total nitrogen sources at room temperature via a pathway
/encoded by genes in the <i>rut</i> operon |CITS: [16540542]|.

COMMENT - In the respiratory chain fromed by hydrogenase and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) reductase the transfer of electrons from hydrogen to DMSO is coupled to the generation of a proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. Electron flow from H(2) to DMSO results in the formation of a proton gradient in whole cells and membrane vesicles of <i>E. coli</i> HB101; proton translocation is blocked by the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide <i>p</i>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (CCPP) and by the quinone analog 2-<i>n</i>-heptyl-4-hydroxy-quinoline-<i>N</i>-oxide (HOQNO) |CITS: [2989249]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 contains two membrane bound, H(2) uptake hydrogenases - |FRAME: FORMHYDROGI-CPLX "hydrogenase 1"| (Hyd1) and hydrogenase 2 (Hyd 2). Hyd 2 is a standard O<sub>2</sub> sensitive hydrogenase and is the major hydrogenase during anaerobic respiration with hydrogen and fumarate |CITS: [3905769] [11506918]| while Hyd 1 is an O<sub>2</sub> tolerant hydrogenase whose physiological function is not yet clearly defined (see for example |CITS: [24715724][23260654]|.
/
/Hyd 2 is presumed to be an energy conserving enzyme (see |CITS: [9230919]|). H2-dependent reduction of the quinol analogs, menadione and ubiquinone-1, in <i>E. coli</i> spheroplasts is coupled to a protonophore-sensitive, proton translocation with H+/2e- stoichiometry of approx. 2 |CITS: [6249272]|. 
/
/DMSO reductase functions under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of nitrate (a preferred electron acceptor) |CITS: [2544558]|. DMSO reductase does not contribute to proton potential |CITS: [9063459]| (and see review by |CITS: [18930017]|).

COMMENT - In the anaerobic respiratory chain formed by NADH dehydrogenase I (NDH-1) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)
/reductase the transfer of electrons from NADH to TMAO is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [7000002]|. 
/
/By analogy to the related enzyme from mitochondria, NDH-I is thought to function as a proton pump translocating 4H<sup>+</sup> per NADH oxidised (2e<sup>-</sup>) [H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 2] however a lower ratio of 3H<sup>+</sup>/2e<sup>-</sup> has also been proposed |CITS: [8892824], [22392981]|. TMAO reductase does not contribute to proton potential and thus proton pumping by NDH-I is the only mechanism for proton motive force (PMF) generation in anaerobic NADH &rarr; TMAO respiration (see review by |CITS: [18930017]|. Menaquinone (shown here) or demethylmenaquinone serves as the redox mediator during anaerobic respiration with TMAO |CITS: [2204318], [1444716]|.

COMMENT - In the respiratory chain formed by NADH dehydrogenase I (NDH-1) and fumarate reductase (FRD) the transfer of electrons from NADH to fumarate is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. Two electrons are transferred from the NADH oxidation site of NDH-1 to the fumarate reduction site of FRD by a menaquinone pool. 
/
/Anaerobic growth of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 with fumarate operates preferentially with NDH-I. Electron transport from NADH to fumarate decreases significantly in a strain lacking NDH-I compared to wild-type. No significant decrease occurs in a strain lacking NADH dehydrogenase II (NDH-II) |CITS: [9063459]|    
/
/By analogy to the related enzyme from mitochondria, NDH-I is believed to function as a proton pump translocating 4 H<sup>+</sup> per NADH oxidized (2e<sup>-</sup>), however, a lower ratio of 3H<sup>+</sup>/2e<sup>-</sup> has also been proposed |CITS: [22392981]|.  The H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> ratio for NDH-1 is at least 1.5 |CITS: [8892824]|. Fumarate reductase does not contribute to the generation of proton potential |CITS: [10373108]|. Proton pumping by NDH-I is the only mechanism for PMF generation in the NADH to fumarate electron transport chain |CITS: [9063459]| 
/
/Expression of the <i>nuo</i> operon, encoding NDH-1 is stimulated by fumarate |CITS: [9063459]|. Expression of the <i>frd</i> operon is repressed by the preferred electron acceptors, oxygen and nitrate and induced by fumarate  |CITS: [2999070], [3298218] [3035558]|.

COMMENT - In the anaerobic respiratory chain formed by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase the transfer of electrons from glycerol-3-phosphate to nitrate is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. Nitrate reduction in whole cells or membrane vesicles of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 can be coupled to the oxidation of glycerol-3-phosphate |CITS: [127786][5996]|; oxidation of glycerol-3-phosphate with nitrate as electron acceptor supports the anaerobic transport of lactose and amino acids in membrane vesicles of <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [1099094]|
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 contains two energy conserving (H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 1) nitrate reductases. Nitrate reductase A (NRA) is the major anaerobic nitrate reductase; expression of NRA occurs in response to high levels of nitrate in the environment whereas expression of nitrate reductase Z (NRZ) is not dependent on nitrate levels or anaerobiosis |CITS: [2832376][10464201]|. NRZ expression is dependent on |FRAME: RPOS-MONOMER "&sigma;<sup>S</sup>"|; NRZ may assist the cell to use nitrate efficiently under stress conditions |CITS: [10564515]|. NRZ may be important during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions |CITS: [2139607]|.   
/
/<i>E. coli</i> also contains two glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases - an anaerobic enzyme encoded by <i>glpABC</i> (shown in this pathway) and an aerobic enzyme encoded by <i>glpD</i>. Either enzyme suffices for anaerobic growth with glycerol or glycerol-3-phosphate as the electron donor and nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor; GlpABC is required for anaerobic growth with glycerol (or glycerol-3-phosphate) and fumarate while |FRAME: AERGLYC3PDEHYDROG-MONOMER "GlpD"| is required for aerobic growth with glycerol (or glycerol-3-phosphate) (|CITS: [4945192], [127786]| and review by |CITS: [3045516]|. The ratio of GlpD to GlpABC is high when oxygen or nitrate serves as a terminal electron acceptor and low when fumarate serves this role |CITS: [4580569]|.
/
/Quinones are the obligate redox carriers during anaerobic nitrate respiration; the concentration of menaquinone increases in cells grown anaerobically with nitrate while the concentration of ubiquinone decreases (as compared with cells grown aerobically) |CITS: [195602]|. NRA can use both menaquinol (shown in this pathway) and ubiquinol as electron donors |CITS: [2204318], [1444716]|. In anaerobic growth with nitrate and glycerol-3-phosphate as electron donor the major quinone is demethylmenaquinone (DMK) |CITS: [2849923]|; an <i>E. coli</i> strain containing only DMK is unable to grow with nitrate as terminal reductase |CITS: [1444716]|.

COMMON-NAME - D-fructuronate degradation
COMMENT - Multiple degradation pathways lead to the metabolite |FRAME: FRUCTURONATE|. One group of such pathways is the degradation of glucuronate-containing polymers such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans|. These pathways contain a step for the removal of |FRAME: GLUCURONATE| residues, which are then converted to |FRAME: FRUCTURONATE| by the action of |FRAME: EC-5.3.1.12| |CITS: [13794771]|.
/
/|FRAME: FRUCTURONATE| is converted in three steps (dehydrogenation, dehydration, and phosphorylation) to |FRAME: 2-KETO-3-DEOXY-6-P-GLUCONATE|, which is then cleaved by |FRAME: EC-4.1.2.14| to form the central metabolites |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: GAP|, leading to the TCA cycle and glycolysis (the last two steps are known as the |FRAME: PWY-2221 "semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway"|).

COMMENT - In whole cells of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 formate dependent nitrite reduction is associated with the generation of a proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [MOTTERAM81] [6283015]|. Nitrite reduction
/by formate is dependent on menaquinone (shown in this pathway) and/or demethylmenaquinone for electron transfer |CITS: [9325429]|.
/
/Maximum nrf (<U>n</U>itrite <U>r</U>eduction by <U>f</U>ormate) activity is found in cells grown anaerobically in the presence of formate and nitrite |CITS: [37075]|. <i>E. coli</i> K-12 contains two nitrite reductases - a periplasmic respiratory enzyme (shown in this pathway) encoded by genes from the <i>nrf</i> operon  and a cytoplasmic NADH dependent enzyme (|FRAME: NITRITREDUCT-CPLX|) whose physiological function is proabably to detoxify nitrite. <i>nrf</i> expression is induced anaerobically in an Fnr-dependent manner and further regulated in response to environmental levels of nitrate and nitrite |CITS: [2173895][7854119][8057835][11004182]|. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 contains three membrane assocated formate dehydrogenases. Formate dehydrogenase N (FDH-N) and formate dehydrogenase O (FDH-O) (both shown in this pathway) are respiratory enzymes while |FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGH-MONOMER "formate dehydrogenase H"| (FDH-H) (not shown here) is generally considered to be active under fermentative conditions where it forms part of the formate hydrogen-lyase complex (see review by |CITS: [7747941]|). However, all three enzymes may be active in formate dependent nitrite reduction |CITS: [8409924][12923080]|. A mutant strain lacking all three enzymes is Nrf <sup>-</sup> (unable to catalyse formate dependent nitrite reduction); an &Delta;FDH-O&Delta;FDH-N double mutant has less than 10% of the Nrf activity of the parent strain |CITS: [8409924]|.
/
/Nitrite reduction by other electron donors such as pyruvate, ethanol and lactate has been reported (see |CITS: [12165429]| and references within) but are thought to be be minor pathways.

COMMENT - In the respiratory chain formed by formate dehydrogenase and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase the transfer of electrons from formate to DMSO is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. Weak, but measurable proton translocation can be demonstrated in whole cells of <i>E. coli</i> HB101 with formate as electron donor and DMSO as acceptor |CITS: [2989249]|.  
/

Formate dehydrogenase N contributes to the generation of proton potential (H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 1) by means of a redox loop mechanism |CITS: [11884747]| . 
/
/DMSO reductase  functions under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of nitrate (a preferred electron acceptor) |CITS: [2544558]|. DMSO reductase does not contribute to proton potential (|CITS: [9063459]| and see review by |CITS: [18930017]|).

Two electrons are transferred from the formate oxidation site in the periplasm to the site of nitrate reduction in the cytoplasm by a menaquinone pool which drives proton translocation in the opposite direction.    
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 contains two respiratory formate dehydrogenases. Formate dehydrogenase N (FDH-N) is induced by anaerobiosis and the presence of nitrate |CITS: [12923080], [2168848]| whereas aerobic conditions, and to a lesser extent nitrate under anaerobic conditions, induce expression of formate dehydrogenase O (FDH-O) |CITS: [8522521]|. Formate dehydrogenase N contributes to the generation of proton potential (H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 1); oxidation of formate in the periplasm is accompanied by menaquinone reduction at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane |CITS: [Jones80] [11884747]|. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 also contains two energy conserving (H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 1) nitrate reductases. Expression of nitrate reductase A (NRA) occurs in response to high levels of nitrate in the environment whereas expression of nitrate reductase Z (NRZ) is not dependent on nitrate levels or anaerobiosis |CITS: [10464201]|. 
/
/FDH-N and NRA are coupled together in the anaerobic formate to nitrate electron transfer pathway when levels of nitrate are high. FDH-O and NRZ also couple together to catalyse formate dependent nitrate reduction - this pathway operates when cell suspensions from aerobically grown cultures are placed under anaerobic conditions and thus its physiological importance may be in the transition to anaerobiosis |CITS: [1504073] [8522521]|.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can use &beta;-D-glucuronides and the hexuronates D-glucuronate and D-fructuronate and as the
/sole sources of carbon for growth.  &beta;-D-glucuronides are detoxification products that are excreted into the
/mammalian gut in the bile.  D-glucuronate is found in animal mucus and at low levels in plant tissues.  The enzymes of
/this pathway were first described in a series of publications by Ashwell et al.
/|CITS: [13584413][13794771][14401695][13831814][13813474]|.
/
/The initial step in the degradation of &beta;-glucuronides is hydrolysis by |FRAME: CPLX0-7662| to yield
/D-glucuronate, which is subsequently isomerized to D-fructuronate by D-glucuronate isomerase, an enzyme which
/can carry out the analogous function in the |FRAME: GALACTUROCAT-PWY| pathway.  D-fructuronate then
/undergoes an NADH-dependent reduction to D-mannonate by |FRAME: MANNONOXIDOREDUCT-MONOMER|. 
/|FRAME: MANNONDEHYDRAT-MONOMER| subsequently catalyzes dehydration to yield
/2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate.  At this point, the |FRAME: GLUCUROCAT-PWY| and
/|FRAME: GALACTUROCAT-PWY| pathways converge, and a common enzyme,
/|FRAME: DEOXYGLUCONOKIN-MONOMER|, phosphorylates 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate to yield
/2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-6-phosphate, which enters central metabolism via the

COMMENT - In the anaerobic respiratory chain formed by NADH dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase the transfer of electrons from NADH to nitrate is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane (|CITS: [4385809], [5996] [776172]| and see |CITS: [9230919]|).
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 contains two NADH dehydrogenases - NDH-II (shown in this pathway) which does not contribute to the proton gradient and energy conserving NDH-I; both enzymes appear to be involved in anaerobic nitrate respiration |CITS: [7565112], [9063459]|. Nitrate respiration with NADH is only slightly affected in a strain lacking NDH-I but significantly reduced in a strain lacking NDH-II suggesting that NDH-II is used preferentially in nitrate respiration |CITS: [9063459]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 also contains two energy conserving (H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> = 1) nitrate reductases.

/
/Quinones are the obligate redox carriers during anaerobic nitrate respiration; the concentration of menaquinone increases in cells grown anaerobically with nitrate while the concentration of ubiquinone decreases (as compared with cells grown aerobically) |CITS: [195602]|. Nitrate reductase A can use both ubiquinol (shown in this pathway) and menaquinol as electron donors |CITS: [2204318], [1444716]|. In anaerobic growth with nitrate the major quinone is demethylmenaquinone (DMK) |CITS: [2849923]|; an <i>E. coli</i> strain containing only demethylmenaquinone is unable to grow with nitrate as terminal reductase |CITS: [1444716]|.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i> the disaccharide lactose is degraded by hydrolysis of the &beta;-1,4 glycosidic bond by 
/&beta;-galactosidase, producing &beta;-D-glucose and &beta;-D-galactose.  The enzyme can also catalyze 
/conversion of lactose to allolactose (&beta;-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-6)-D-glucopyranose) by transglycosylation, 
/and can hydrolyze allolactose (in |CITS: [6767683]|).  Allolactose is the physiological inducer of this pathway.  
/
/Further metabolism of glucose and galactose inside the cell is thought to proceed by their initial transport out of the 
/cell, followed by reentry.  It has been shown that when lactose is added to a growing culture of <i>E. coli</i>, 
/galactose, glucose and allolactose reach high levels inside the cells and are rapidly effluxed into the medium 
/|CITS: [6767683]|.  It has also been shown that an <i>E. coli </i> mutant defective in the uptake of glucose and 
/galactose grew poorly with lactose as a sole carbon source.  Additional transport rate and radiotracer studies 
/supported the efflux mechanism |CITS: [6426769]|.  No <i>E. coli</i> genes specifically involved in sugar efflux during 
/lactose metabolism have been conclusively identified.  However, SetA and SetB, members of the SET 
/(sugar efflux transporter) family may have a role |CITS: [10438463] [10209755]|.
/
/It has been suggested that as glucose reenters the cell it could be phosphorylated to glucose-1-phosphate by the 
/phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (in |CITS: [6767683]|).  Glucose-1-phosphate could then be 
/converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase and enter glycolysis.  Galactose could reenter the cell 
/by facilitated diffusion (in |CITS: [6767683]|), or active transport systems <i>gal</i>P, or <i>mgl</i> 
/(Lin in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|).  Galactose can also be converted to glucose-1-phosphate 
/(Fraenkel in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|).  (See EcoCyc pathways:  glucose and glucose-1-phosphate degradation; 
/galactose degradation I; and superpathway of glycolysis and Entner-Doudoroff).  
/
/The <i>E. coli lac</i>Z gene coding for &beta;-galactosidase is the first of three structural genes of the historically 
/significant <i>lac</i> operon.  The study of this operon provided the primary basis for the original operon concept 
/|CITS: [13718526]|.  Lactose and other galactosides are transported into the cell by lactose permease, the product of 
/the second structural gene of the operon |CITS: [12893935]|.  The third structural gene codes for galactoside 
/acetyltransferase (thiogalactoside transacetylase).  The proposed function of this enzyme is acetylation of potentially 
/toxic pyranosides that are exported from the cell, thereby preventing their reentry |CITS: [11937062]|.  A review of 
/biochemical studies of the three <i>lac</i> enzymes by Zabin and Fowler can be found in |CITS: [Operon78]|.

COMMON-NAME - glycerol and glycerophosphodiester degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Glycerol uptake in bacteria is mediated by the glycerol diffusion facilitator, an integral membrane protein 
/catalyzing the rapid equilibration of concentration gradients of glycerol across the cytoplasmic 
/membrane |CITS: [8436953]|. 
/Intracellular glycerol is converted to glycerol-3-Phosphate (Glycerol-3-P) by the enzyme glycerol kinase that uses 
/ATP as phosphoryl donor. Glycerol-3-P is not a substrate of the glycerol diffusion facilitator and thus remains 
/in the cell, where it is further metabolized. 
/As a result, the driving force for the uptake of glycerol is generated by the 
/phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase |CITS: [9162046]|. 
/
/
/While Glycerol-3-P can not leave the cytoplasm, it can be imported into 
/the cell by the GlpT transporter, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, that couples the import of glycerol-3-P 
/into the cytoplasm to the export of inorganic phosphates from the cytoplasm to the periplasm 
/|CITS: [3522583][12893936]|. 
/
/
/In addition, <i>E. coli</i> K12 possesses two systems the salvage of
/glycerophosphoryl diesters, the Glp system and the Ugp system. 
/
/In the Glp system, the <i>glpQ</i> gene encodes a periplasmic glycerophosphoryl diester
/phosphodiesterase (periplasmic GDP) which hydrolyzes deacylated phospholipids to
/an alcohol plus Glycerol-3-P . The Glycerol-3-P is then transported into the cell by the GlpT transporter.
/Periplasmic GDP is specific for the glycerophospho- moiety of the substrate, while the
/alcohol can be any one of several alcohols. This provides the cell
/with the capability of channeling a wide variety of
/glycerophosphodiesters into the <i>glpQT</i>-encoded dissimilatory system.
/
/
/In the Ugp system the diesters are hydrolyzed during transport at the
/cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to Glycerol-3-P plus alcohol by a cytoplasmic GDP, an enzyme
/encoded by the <i>ugpQ</i> gene. 
/The Ugp system is induced when the cells are starved for inorganic phospate, which is  generates phosphate by 
/the system |CITS: [1851953]|. 
/
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> glycerol-3-P can be further metabolized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by either of two 
/membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage 
/of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. 
/Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic glycerol-3-P 
/dehydrogenase (encoded by the <i>glpD</i> gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the 
/electron acceptor |CITS: [340460]|.  
/Under anaerobic conditions, a different glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase is preferentially expressed. This 
/tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the <i>glpACB</i> opron, channels the electrons from 
/glycerol-3-P to either fumarate or nitrate |CITS: [3286606]|.

COMMENT - Aspartate undergoes a number of reactions that are not in

/aspartate.  Another reaction irreversibly converts aspartate to
/asparagine. A third reaction facilitates reversible interconversion of

/fumarate and succinate during anaerobic growth on glucose.
/|CITS: [6088667] [2853974]|
/
/In
/addition to its role in synthesis of asparagine, aspartate serves as a
/precursor in synthesis of lysine, methionine and threonine, plus the
/pyrimidines.  Also the intermediate argininosuccinate hydrolyses to
/give citrulline and aspartate.

COMMENT - |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (UDP-GlcNAc) is an essential precursor of cell wall peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide and enterobacterial common antigen.  This situates UDP-GlcNAc at a branch point in metabolism, each fork leading to synthesis of a major envelope component of the cell |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.  The enzymes of these pathways are targets for development of novel antibacterial compounds (reviewed in |CITS: [17692001]|).
/
/|FRAME: L-GLN-FRUCT-6-P-AMINOTRANS-CPLX|, or GFAT, catalyzes the first committed step in UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis from fructose-6-phosphate.  The product of this first reaction, |FRAME: D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P|, can also be transported into the cell and utilized as a source of carbon; thus, expression of GFAT is controlled at several levels.  For details on regulation and the mechanism of uncoupling it from the regulation of |FRAME: EG11198| expression, please see the protein page: |FRAME: L-GLN-FRUCT-6-P-AMINOTRANS-CPLX|.
/
/|FRAME: D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P| is then converted to |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINE-1P| by |FRAME: PHOSGLUCOSAMINEMUT-MONOMER|.  The two final reactions of the pathway, transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to form |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE-1-P| and transfer of a uridyl group to form the final product, UDP-GlcNAc, are carried out by a bifunctional enzyme, GlmU, which contains two domains that carry out each reaction independently.

COMMENT - Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| , which is converted to AMP by the action of
/|FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|). Note that the free base |FRAME: ADENINE| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: ADENOSINE| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE|) and  free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|).
/
/However, both |FRAME: ADENOSINE| and |FRAME: ADENINE| can be salvaged by certain enzymes, and be converted back to nucleotide form.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: DEOD-CPLX "purine phosphorylase (DeoD)"| (EC 2.4.2.1) cleaves |FRAME: ADENOSINE| to |FRAME: ADENINE| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-1P|, while a second enzyme, such as |FRAME: ADENPRIBOSYLTRAN-CPLX|, can utilize |FRAME: PRPP| to convert the free base to the mononucleotide |FRAME: AMP|.
/
/Another route from |FRAME: ADENOSINE| to |FRAME: AMP| is acheived in a single step by the enzyme |FRAME: HS08097-MONOMER| (EC 2.7.1.20). The enzyme has been described in bacteria, yeast, plants and animals |CITS: [5092557][8577746][11115893][16511094][17869216][19329636]|.

COMMENT - Phospholipids are membrane components in E. coli. The major phospholipids of
/E. coli are phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin.
/All phospholipids contain <I>sn</I>-glycerol-3-phosphate esterified with fatty
/acids at the <I>sn</I>-1 and <I>sn</I>-2 positions. 
/
/In addition to providing the membrane matrix, phospholipids are also involved in
/synthesizing several types of surface molecules. The phosphoethanolamine head
/groups of phosphatidylethanolamine are transferred and attached to the 
/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core sugars and to periplasmic membrane-derived 
/oligosaccharides (MDO). The head group of phosphatidylglycerol is used for 
/modifying various lipoproteins and MDO. The entire molecule is used in the 
/synthesis of cardiolipin.   |CITS: [2404013] [ColiSalII]|

COMMENT - Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins.  It is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles.
/It is biosynthesized as protoheme, but different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|, |FRAME: HEME_A|, |FRAME: HEME_C|, and |FRAME: HEME_D|.
/
/This superpathway shows the two routes of synthesis found in the facultative anaerobe E. coli. Under aerobic conditions, the transition from |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN| is catalyzed by the oxygen -dependent |FRAME: COPROGENOXI-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.3.3). However, when oxygen is not available, the organism is still able to catalyze this transition, using the readical-SAM enzyme |FRAME: HEMN-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.99.22), which can catalyze the transition without the need for molecular oxygen. This enzyme, which contains an iron-sulfur cluster, is able to break SAM into |FRAME: MET| and a 5'-deoxyadenosineyl radical. This radical can attack |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| and bring about the conversion to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN|.
/
/This enzyme is found in many bacteria, but does not appear to be present in archaea or eukarya (the only reference for the enzyme in a eukaryote is in the organism |FRAME: TAX-5911|, but this finding is based on sequence analysis alone, and has not been verified biochemically).
/
/Important branch points within this pathway lead to biosynthesis of other important compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) (see |FRAME: P381-PWY|), |FRAME: CPD-7425| (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|), heme D biosynthesis, and bacteriochlorophyll (see |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides Lipopolysaccharides| (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; the core oligosaccharide, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.
/
/The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of repeating oligosaccharide subunits made up of three to five sugars. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria.
/
/Gram-positive bacteria and Archaea do not have a lipopolysaccharide. Instead they possess the S-layer (surface layer) as a component of the cell envelope |CITS: [11742749][1938891]|. The S-layer is composed of a single layer of identical proteins or glycoproteins that form a two-dimensional, monomolecular crystalline array |CITS:[7934867]|. Structurally, S-layer glycoproteins from Gram-positive bacteria resemble the O-antigens of Gram-negative organisms, and often contain similar modified sugar building blocks |CITS: [11741945]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: UDP-MANNAC| is synthesized by C-2 epimerisation of |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-5.1.3.14|), and |FRAME: UDP-MANNACA| is synthesized by dehydrogenation of |FRAME: UDP-MANNAC|, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.336|.
/
/The pathway was first established as part of the synthesis of the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), which contains the modified sugar |FRAME: CPD-15664| (see |FRAME: ECASYN-PWY|), but the genes were subsequently identified in the polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters of other bacteria, such as the Vi cluster of |FRAME: ORG-6239| and the capsule biosynthesis cluster of |FRAME: TAX-1280|, in which |FRAME: CPD-15664| participates in the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen| and the capsule glycoprotein, respectively..
/
/Originally named |FRAME: EG11451| and |FRAME: EG11452|, the recommended name for these genes is now <i>mnaA</i> and <i>mnaB</i> |CITS: [14670712]|.
/
/The structure of MnmA has been described, and reveals a surprising structural homology with glycogen phosphorylase |CITS: [11106477]|. The MnaB protein from |FRAME: TAX-1280| (known as Cap5O) has been biochemically characterized |CITS: [11159986]|.

COMMON-NAME - sulfate reduction I (assimilatory)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Sulfur is an essential nutrient for all life forms.  Plants, fungi, and many bacteria reduce inorganic sulfate to sulfide to cover their need for the element.  Before the sulfur can be assimilated into biosynthetic pathways it needs to be reduced to |FRAME: HS|.  Pathways catalyzing the reduction of sulfate to sulfide for the purpose of incorporation into newly synthesized molecules are called pathways of <b>assimilatory sulfate reduction</b>.  In addition, certain organisms can use sulfate as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen.  Pathways of sulfate reduction for the purpose of energy production are called pathways of <b>dissimilatory sulfate reduction</b>.
/
/The reduction of sulfate to sulfite requires two electrons at a standard redox potential (<i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i>) of -516 mV, which is too high for physiological electron carriers |CITS: [860983]|.  The problem is solved by the activation of the sulfate, by forming a mixed anhydride between phosphate and sulfate as in |FRAME: APS| (APS) or |FRAME: PAPS| (PAPS).  This linkage lowers the potential to <i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i> = -60 mV, which is easily covered by thiols or pyrimidine nucleotides |CITS: [14627706]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In many bacteria and lower eukaryotes, assimilatory sulfate reduction proceeds via activation of |FRAME: SULFATE| to APS by the enzyme |FRAME: SULFATE-ADENYLYLTRANS-CPLX| (also known as ATP sulfurylase).  This enzyme has an unfavorable equilibrium (K<sub>eq</sub> ~ 10<sup>-7</sup> M) in the direction of APS formation, and it has been postulated that the reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of PP<sub>i</sub> by a ubiquitous inorganic pyrophosphatase |CITS: [2821345]|.  In |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was found that the enzymes couples the formation of APS to hydrolysis of GTP |CITS: [8117661]|.
/
/Following sulfate activation, the pathway consists of phosphorylation of APS to PAPS, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: ADENYLYLSULFKIN-CPLX| (APS kinase), reduction to |FRAME: SO3|, which is catalyzed by the thioredoxin (or glutaredoxin)-dependent |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| (PAPS reductase), and a final reduction of sulfite to sulfide, catalyzed by a |FRAME: SULFITE-REDUCT-ENZRXN|.

COMMENT - This is the synthesis pathway of an element in lipopolysaccharide present in ECA, the enterobacterial common antigen, and in O-antigen. <i>E. coli</i> K12 lacks at least one enzyme necessary for O-antigen synthesis due to mutations in the <i>rfb</i> gene cluster.  |CITS: [7517391] [7512872]| All four L-rhamnose biosynthesis genes (<i>rfbA, rfbB, rfbC</i> and <i>rfbD</i>) have been characterized. dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, which is encoded by the <i>rfbA</i> gene, catalyzes the formation of dTDP-glucose. dTDP-glucose is then converted to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose by dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, which is encoded by the <i>rfbB</i> gene. dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase, encoded by the <i>rfbC</i> gene, forms a complex with dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase, encoded by <i>rfbD</i> gene.

COMMENT - Enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) is an outer membrane glycolipid common to all members of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. ECA is a unique cell surface antigen that can be found in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. The carbohydrate portion consists of N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid and 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose. These amino sugars form trisaccharide repeat units which are part of linear heteropolysaccharide chains. |CITS: [2166030]|

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is a common compound found in all kingdoms of life.
/In some Gram-negative bacteria it is a precursor for synthesis of the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, a component of the outer membrane |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides| (see |FRAME: PWY-7328|), or of cell wall components such as |FRAME: CPD0-1099| (see |FRAME: COLANSYN-PWY|). In some Gram-positive bacteria it is involved in the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide |CITS:[7929009]|.
/
/In plants a large amount of the cell-wall biomass is derived from |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| through the complex interconversion of nucleotide sugars (for review see |CITS:[15134748]|). |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is converted to a number of other sugars including |FRAME: UDP-D-GALACTURONATE|, |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| and |FRAME: CPD-12513| (see |FRAME: PWY-5114|), which form diverse plant cell wall |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|.
/
/In animals |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is an intermediate in the synthesis of |FRAME: ASCORBATE| by certain organsisms (see |FRAME: PWY3DJ-35471| and |FRAME: PWY-6415|). The other anomeric form, |FRAME: CPD-12521|, is found in |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycan| side chains of proteoglycan core proteins and polymers, such as |FRAME: Hyaluronan| and |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates|. It is also the substrate for liver glucuronosyltransferases that glucuronidate xenobiotics and some endogenous compounds in an important pathway for the metabolism of toxins and drugs. The resulting glucuronides are rapidly excreted through the biliary tract or kidneys (in |CITS: [9737970]|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The most common route for formation of |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is by the hydroxylation of |FRAME: CPD-12575|, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.22|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD0-1099 "Colanic acid"|, also known as the M antigen, is an extracellular polysaccharide found in |FRAME: TAX-543|. It is a polyanionic heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with |FRAME: D-Glucose|, |FRAME: L-fucoses|, |FRAME: D-Galactose|, and |FRAME: GLUCURONATE| sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with O-acetyl and pyruvate side chains |CITS: [4902806 ][4941627]|. The sugars need to be activated in the form of nucleotide sugars (|FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CPD-13118|, |FRAME: CPD-14553| and |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE|, respectively) prior to their assembly |CITS: [8759852] [8763957]|.
/
/The |FRAME: CPD0-1099| polysaccharide repeat is assembled on the membrane lipid |FRAME: CPD-9650| by a series of glycosyl transferases on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, after which the single repeat is flipped to the periplasmic side and polymerized by the Wzy-dependent pathway (reviewed in |CITS: [12045108]| and |CITS: [16756484]|).
/Subsequently, the polymer is believed to be cleaved from the |FRAME: CPD-9650| anchor, transported across the periplasm, and excreted into the extracellular space, although this process is not well understood.
/
/|FRAME: CPD0-1099 "Colanic acid"| biosynthesis has been linked to a cluster of 19 genes, which were named <i>wca</i> |CITS:[8759852][8763957]|. This gene cluster is tightly regulated by a complex signal transduction cascade governed by the rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) phosphorelay system |CITS: [3888955][16153174]|.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can use all three naturally occurring purine deoxyribonucleosides (deoadenosine, deoxyguanosine, and
/deoxyinosine) as total sources of carbon and energy.  All are cleaved by the same <i>deoD</i>-encoded
/phosphorylase, yielding the corresponding bases (adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine) and
/D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate, which is converted to D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that also can utilize
/D-ribose-1-phosphate as a substrate.  A specific aldolase splits D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, yielding
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which enters central metabolism through the glycolytic pathway, and acetaldehyde,
/which must be converted to acetyl-CoA before it can enter central metabolism. 
/
/Although <i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize the deoxyribose moiety of deoxyribonucleosides, it is unable to utilize
/exogenously supplied deoxyribose; however, the closely related organism <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> can.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamine diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS: [15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamine-containing husk |CITS: [8710215]|. Thiamine is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The thiamine biosynthesis pathway illustrated here has been most extensively studied in |FRAME: TAX-83333| and |FRAME: TAX-90371|. There are several differences between the pathways employed by |FRAME: TAX-1423| and by |FRAME: TAX-562| (see |FRAME: PWY-6895|). 
/
/Thiamine biosynthesis in bacteria is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P|. A final phosphorylation reaction yields the biologically active form, |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|. 
/
/Although much progress has been made in elucidating the thiamin biosynthetic pathway, not all of the reactions have been thoroughly characterized. 
/
/The biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety is complex and in |FRAME:TAX-562| involves six proteins, the products of the |FRAME: G1|, |FRAME: EG11587|, |FRAME: EG11589|, |FRAME: EG11590|, |FRAME: G6238|, and |FRAME: G7325| genes. 
/
/The process begins when IscS, a protein that is also involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from cysteine to |FRAME: Sulfur-Carrier-Proteins-ThiI|, generating a |FRAME: Sulfurylated-ThiI|. In a parallel route, |FRAME: ThiF-Proteins| catalyzes a two-step process: First, the activation of |FRAME: Thi-S| by adenylation of its carboxy terminus, generating |FRAME: Adenylated-ThiS-Proteins|, and second, the subsequent exchange of the adenylate with the |FRAME: Sulfurylated-ThiI "ThiI persulfide"|, generating |FRAME: ThiS-ThiI-disulfides|. The next step is a disulfide interchange, where a |FRAME: Sulfurylated-ThiF "ThiF sulfur-carrier protein"| replaces the |FRAME: Sulfurylated-ThiI "ThiI"| moiety, resulting in |FRAME: ThiS-ThiF-disulfides|.
/
/This dual-protein disulfide finally acts as the sulfur donor for thiazole formation, in a reaction that also involves |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| and |FRAME: CPD-12279|, and is catalyzed by the |FRAME: THIG-MONOMER| protein. |FRAME: CPD-12279| is formed in |FRAME:TAX-562| from |FRAME: TYR| by |FRAME: THIH-MONOMER| (ThiH), which forms a complex with |FRAME: THIG-MONOMER| |CITS: [9632726][11438688][16388576]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin is not simple either. Starting with |FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE|, an intermediate in purine biosynthesis, two enzymatic steps, catalyzed by |FRAME: THIC-MONOMER| and |FRAME: HMP-P-KIN-CPLX "ThiD"|, produce |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|. The first of these reactions is one of the most complex rearrangement reactions known.
/
/Finally, the two moieties are condensed together by |FRAME: THIE-MONOMER|, and phosphorylated to the final form, |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|, by |FRAME: THI-P-KIN-MONOMER|.

COMMENT - Glycogen is a glucose-containing polysaccharide, comprised of approximately 95% &alpha;-1,4 linkages and 5% &alpha;-1,6 branch glucosyl linkages, with an average chain length of 12 to 14 glucose units.  ADP-glucose is the glucosyl donor, which is transferred to either a maltodextrin or glycogen primer, forming a new &alpha;-1,4-glucosidic linkage.  The first enzyme of the pathway, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, is rate-limiting.  After chain elongation, the formation of the branched &alpha;-1,6-glucosidic linkages from the growing polyglucose chain is catalyzed by the glycogen branching enzyme.

COMMENT - The pathway of valine biosynthesis is a four-step pathway that shares all
/of its steps with the parallel pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis. These
/entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates
/not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.
/
/As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis
/of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject
/to regulation by all three amino acids. The first step in the pathway is primarily
/inhibited by valine, along with inhibition by isoleucine and leucine.
/The potential disruption this might cause to the parallel
/isoleucine biosynthesis pathway step using the same enzymes is resolved by
/upregulation of an earlier step that is unique to isoleucine biosynthesis, as explained
/in the |FRAME:ILEUSYN-PWY| summary. In this way, valine biosynthesis can be regulated
/independently of isoleucine biosynthesis, despite all four valine biosynthesis enzymes
/also participating in isoleucine biosynthesis.

COMMENT - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major outer membrane component, is composed of three domains: Lipid A; the core, which is an oligosaccharide consisting of an inner and outer region; and a distal repeating unit known as O-antigen. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K12 is capable of producing an O-antigen when all the <i>rfb</i> genes are intact. The O-antigen is part of the lipopolysaccharide and is attached to the lipid A-core component, which is separately synthesized. The O-antigen is a repeat unit composed of four sugars: glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose and rhamnose.  
/
/This pathway depicts the synthesis of three of these sugars. UDP-galactose is transformed from its pyranose form to its furanose form. dTTP glucose-1-phosphate is derivatized to dTDP-rhamnose. Fructose-6-phosphate gains an amino group, incorporates an acetate moiety and then acquires a nucleoside diphosphate resulting in UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
/
/During formation of the repeat unit, the nucleoside diphosphates are removed. The repeat unit is polymerized and attached to the outer core.  Formation and polymerization of the O-antigen repeat unit is not shown here as it is a complex macromolecular transformation which presently lies outside the scope of

COMMENT - The synthesis of lysine, methionine and threonine share
/the first two reactions of the three pathways, the reactions
/converting L-aspartate to L-aspartate semialdehyde.  There are three
/aspartate kinases, three isozymes coded for by the lysC, metL and thrA genes, one

/coded by the asd gene serves all three pathways.  The third reaction
/is shared by the methionine and threonine pathways.  Homoserine
/dehydrogenase, part of multifunctional enzymes, is coded by the metL
/and thrA genes.  Therefore, independent regulation of the three
/pathways is possible.  The synthesis of methionine is linked to

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of adenosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis II
CITATIONS - ecosal:EV-EXP-TAS:3533406736:fulcher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/<i>De novo</i> biosynthesis of purines starts with the synthesis of IMP which can be converted to all other purines.  In <i>E. coli</i> IMP is synthesized in a total of 11 enzymatic reactions in which the purine ring is formed by stepwise addition of small molecules to 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose-1-phosphate (PRPP).  The first five reactions are shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY-6121| and |FRAME: PWY-6122| which illustrate the alternative use of two phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferases encoded by <i>purN</i> and  <i>purT</i>.  The last six reactions leading to IMP are shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6123|.  IMP can then be converted to guanosine nucleotides as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6125|, or adenosine nucleotides as shown in this pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/IMP is converted to adenylo-succinate by the enzyme |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCCINATE-SYN-DIMER| (PurA) and the latter compound is converted to the first adenosine nucleotide, AMP, by the |FRAME: AMPSYN-ENZRXN| activity of PurB.
/
/AMP is then converted to ADP and subsequently to ATP.  The AMP to ADP conversion is catalyzed by |FRAME: ADENYL-KIN-MONOMER|, a specific nucleoside monophosphate kinase.  Numerous reactions can convert ADP to ATP and they can be found in multiple pathways including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis.  However, a major source for this conversion is the |FRAME: ATPSYN-CPLX| complex, which is membrane bound and utilizes a proton gradient across membranes to phosphorylate ADP.  This is the reaction depicted in this pathway.
/
/ADP can also be converted to the deoxy form dADP by either |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX| (NrdAB) or |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTII-CPLX| (NrdEF).  dADP is converted to dATP by |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| (Ndk).  Under strictly anaerobic conditions, the |FRAME: ENZRXN0-805| activity of the class III ribonucleotide reductase NrdD can convert ATP to its deoxy form.
/
/In bacteria, genetic studies have indicated that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked, but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the PurR repressor protein |CITS:[2404765]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3495388123:keseler
COMMENT - <b>Background</b>
/
/About 20% of the |FRAME: MET| pool is used as a building block of proteins.  The rest is converted to |FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), the major methyl donor in the cell.  When SAM donates its methyl group, it is converted to |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS|.  This molecule can be recycled back to SAM via the <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle, also known as the activated methyl cycle (AMC).
/
/There are two main variations of this pathway, one found mostly in prokaryotes, while the other is found predominantly, but not exclusively, in eukaryotes.  The main difference between the variants is the processing of |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS| (SAH), the immediate product of the methylation reactions.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway, SAH is first hydrolyzed to |FRAME: CPD-564| by |FRAME: CPLX0-1541|, followed by conversion to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| by |FRAME: EG12712-MONOMER|.  The cycle continues with the methylation of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| to |FRAME: MET| using a methyl group from a methylated folate.  Finally, the cycle is completed with the regeneration of SAM by |FRAME: S-ADENMETSYN-CPLX|.

TYPES - Thiosulfate-Disproportionation
COMMON-NAME - thiosulfate disproportionation III (rhodanese)
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The inorganic sulfur compound |FRAME: S2O3| contains two sulfur atoms: a sulfone-sulfur (oxidation state +V), and a sulfane-sulfur (oxidation state -I).  At low pH, thiosulfate decomposes spontaneously to |FRAME: SO3| and elemental sulfur |CITS: [4552952]|.  At neutral pH, the compound is relatively stable, but several types of bacteria can catalyze its disproportionation in a process in which thiosulfate serves as both an electron donor and an electron acceptor.
/
/Several types of enzymes have been described that are able to catalyze the disproportionation of thiosulfate.  These enzymes have been differentiated based on the nature of the electron donor: some enzymes require thiols for this purpose, others utilize organic electron donors such as pyruvate, as well as molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenase, and some enzymes have only been active <i>in vitro</i> when coupled to cyanide.  These three classes of enzymes are described in the MetaCyc pathways |FRAME:PWY-5277|, |FRAME:PWY-5352| and this pathway, respectively.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase is more often referred to by the name rhodanese, from the German word for thiocyanate, "rhodanid".  The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from suitable sulfur donors to nucleophilic sulfur acceptors.  The original description of rhodanese, purified from bovine mitochondria, used thiosulfate and cyanide for this purpose.  Rhodanese is a widespread enzyme, and has been detected in many major phyla, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic |CITS: [6357923]|.  Despite its ubiquity, the physiological role of rhodanese has not yet been established unambiguously.  It has been suggested that rhodanese is involved in detoxification of cyanide in both mammals |CITS: [3073057][10762072]| and bacteria |CITS: [18685272]|.  It has also been proposed that rhodanese, using the dithiol |FRAME: CPD-296| as the sulfur acceptor, may act as a sulfur insertase involved in the formation of prosthetic groups in iron-sulfur proteins, such as ferredoxin |CITS: [6430704][2983992]|.
/
/Rhodanese performs the reaction by a double displacement formal mechanism.  The crystal structure of rhodanese from |FRAME: TAX-354| has been determined at 1.8 &Aring;, and the study revealed that the active form of the enzyme is a persulfide, where a sulfur is attached to the active cysteine residue |CITS: [10788330]|.  Unlike the enzyme |FRAME: G3O-33772-MONOMER|, which catalyzes a similar reaction in which thiosulfate is disproportionated into |FRAME: SO3| and |FRAME: HS|, monothiols such as glutathione are poor substrates for rhodanese |CITS: [14086740][5333153][10735872]|.
/
/The distinction between thiosulfate reductase and rhodanese is not always straightforward.  For example, Aird et al purified an enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-471| that could catalyze either reaction under different conditions |CITS: [3480285]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3445030707:keseler
COMMENT - Ubiquinone is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in the membrane.  The quinone nucleus of
/ubiquinone is derived directly from chorismate, and the isoprenoid subuntis of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized
/via the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| which feeds isoprene units into the |FRAME: POLYISOPRENSYN-PWY|
/pathway.  Ubiquinone biosynthesis has primarily been elucidated by the use of mutant strains that accumulate
/pathway intermediates; many of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically characterized.
/
/The first committed step of the pathway is the conversion of chorismate to |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate| by
/|FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER|.  The enzyme retains and is efficiently inhibited by the product of the reaction,
/4-hydroxybenzoate, which may present a control mechanism for the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway or a
/mechanism for delivery of 4-hydroxybenzoate to the membrane |CITS: [11455603][11825618]|.
/
/The second step in the pathway is the transfer of the polyisoprenoid tail onto |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate| by the
/membrane-bound |FRAME: 4OHBENZOATE-OCTAPRENYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|.  This is followed by the
/decarboxylation of the ring structure by |FRAME: CPLX0-301| (or possibly by UbiX) to form
/|FRAME: 2-OCTAPRENYLPHENOL|.  Under anaerobic conditions, this compound accumulates in the membrane and
/is not converted into ubiquinone.  Further steps in the pathway require the presence of dioxygen |CITS: [361395]|.
/
/Following is the alternating introduction of three hydroxyl- and three methyl groups.  With the exception of the
/methyltransferase that catalyzes both of the <i>O</i>-methyltransferase reactions, UbiG, none of the enzymes have
/been studied biochemically.  The reactions catalyzed by the three hydroxylases are particularly intriguing, but again
/none of them have been studied biochemically; thus, their substrate and cofactor requirements are unknown.
/
/The enzymes of this pathway may form a membrane-associated complex |CITS: [393264]|.  UbiX shows a genetic
/interaction with UbiG, suggesting a possible physical interaction within a complex |CITS: [16923914]|.
/
/Under anaerobic conditions, alternate enzymes must perform the hydroxylation steps that are carried out by UbiB,
/UbiH, and UbiF under aerobic conditions.  No enzymes of the proposed anaerobic pathway have been identified

COMMENT - The pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis from threonine is a five-step pathway that shares its last four steps with the pathway of valine biosynthesis. These entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME: BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY| that generates not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.
/
/As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject to regulation by all three amino acids. The first enzyme in the pathway, L-threonine deaminase, is downregulated by isoleucine and leucine, but is upregulated by valine. The following pathway step, catalyzed by acetohydroxybutanoate synthases (AHAS) I and III, is inhibited by all three amino acids. This apparent paradox of valine stimulation of step one followed by valine inhibition of step two is a product of the preference of AHAS III for processing of the isoleucine precursor 2-oxobutanoate rather than the valine
/precursor pyruvate. When valine is abundant in the cell, both AHAS enzymes are inhibited, blocking valine production and potentially disrupting isoleucine synthesis as well. However, the stimulation of L-threonine deaminase generates
/a substantial pool of 2-oxobutanoate. Combined with the high affinity of AHAS III for this compound, this allows the isoleucine synthesis to continue despite inhibition caused by the parallel valine synthesis pathway.
/
/Enteric bacteria such as |FRAME: ECOLI| and |FRAME: TAX-90371| have been shown to possess two types of
/threonine dehydratases - a catabolic enzyme, which is induced by threonine, and a constitutively-produced biosynthetic enzyme |CITS: [13405870]|. Both enzymes convert threonine to |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|, but differ in their regulation and expression.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> makes four polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, cadaverine, and aminopropylcadaverine, the syntheses of which are shown both here and in |FRAME: POLYAMSYN-PWY|.  In the absence of exogenous arginine, the principal flow to putrescine and hence spermidine is via ornithine decarboxylase.  In the presence of exogenous arginine, however, when ornithine biosynthesis is halted by repression and feed-back inhibition, biosynthesis of putrescine occurs in two steps from arginine 1) by arginine decarboxylase (which is located in the periplasm so that the arginine that flows into polyamines never mixes with the intracellular pool of that amino acid) and then 2) by agmatinase which produces urea along with putrescine--the only urea-producing reaction in <i>E. coli</i>.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes and are determinants of intracellular communication, in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]|, and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function |CITS: [10446384]|.
/
/There are two basic types of fatty acid (FAS) biosynthesis mechanisms. The type I system is found in mammals and lower eukaryotes. Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794| phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of a holo-[acp].
/
/The best-studied pathway is that of <i>E. coli</i> K-12, from which all the enzymes have been purified and crystallized |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequnce, subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-862|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, and this pathway describes the major route. In it, one acetyl-CoA molecule is converted to malonyl-CoA, which is then activated to malonyl-ACP that is condensed with a second acetyl-CoA molecule to form acetoacetyl-ACP.
/
/The first enzyme in this pathway, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, is the controlling point for the flux of carbon into lipids. It is a biotin-containing multi-enzyme complex with two activities, |FRAME: BIOTIN-CARBOXYL-CPLX| and |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, catalyzing two half reactions that combined condense bicarbonate with acetyl-CoA to yield malonyl-CoA. Further discussion of this enzyme is available in the pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1264|.
/
/The malonyl-CoA is next attached to a holo-[acp] by the enzyme malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase.
/
/The last step of the pathway, the condensation of a second acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP, is carried out by the condensing enzyme &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS). <i>E. coli</i> has three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases: KASI, KASII and KASIII encoded by <i>fabB</i>, <i>fabF</i> and <i>fabH</i> respectively. 
/
/KASIII is the key enzyme in the initiation of fatty acids biosynthesis. It selectively catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-ACP and specifically uses CoA thioesters rather than acyl-ACP as the primer. The products tend to be shorter than the products of KASI and II, which are involved primarily in elongation reactions. Unlike the other two enzymes, KASIII cannot participate in the terminal elongation steps of fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/KASIII is inhibited by long-chain acyl-ACPs, indicating a role in feedback regulation of fatty acid synthesis. Since it catalyzes the first condensation step in fatty acid synthesis, it is able to control the rate of fatty acid initiation.
/
/The substrate specificity of KASIII is a major determining factor in membrane fatty acid composition of an organism. In <i>E. coli</i> the enzyme is highly selective for acetyl-CoA, and thus only straight-chain fatty acids are produced in this organism. |CITS:[10629181]|.
/
/Other potential routes for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are described in |FRAME: PWY-5966| and |FRAME: PWY-5965|.

CITATIONS - ECOSAL:EV-EXP-TAS:3317573144:caspi
COMMENT - L-alanine is an essential component of protein and peptidoglycan.  The latter also contains about three molecules of D-alanine for every L-alanine.  Only about 10 percent of the total alanine synthesized flows into peptidoglycan.
/
/At least three pathways (alanine biosynthesis I, alanine biosynthesis II, and alanine biosynthesis III) contribute to the synthesis of alanine.  Alanine biosynthesis I is established only by existence of the relevant enzymes.  Its contribution to alanine synthesis remains speculative because alanine auxotrophs have not yet been isolated.  Because alanine but not valine represses AvtA, its primary purpose is probably synthesis of L-alanine |CITS: [396446][7040341]|.  Existence of the Alanine biosyntheis II  pathways rests on the evidence that glutamate-pyruvate aminotransferase acitivity is found in crude cell extracts; the enzymes has not been purified nor have mutant alleles of its designated encoding gene (<i>alaB</i>) been isolated |CITS: [396446][4146872]|.  The conversion can also be mediated as a side reaction of alanine racemase |CITS: [9832621]|.  The alanine biosyntheis III pathway, mediated by cysteine desulfurase activity, which is required to donate sulfane sulfur for the synthesis of Fe-S clusters, thiamine, thionucleosides in tRNAs, biotin, lipoic acid, and molybdopterin |CITS: [12382038]|, probably contributes only a minor amount of the cell's alanine requirement, as judged by the cell's total requirement for sulfane sulfur.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Fatty acids are key building blocks for lipids and lipoproteins in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium.  The overall mechanism of fatty acid biosynthesis is conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes and involves initiation and cyclic elongation stages.  Intermediates of the <i>E. coli</i> pathway are used to form specific derivatives such as unsaturated fatty acids, the fatty acids of lipid A, and octanoyl-ACP. 
/
/There are two basic types of fatty acid biosynthesis mechanisms. The type I system is found in mammals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid, while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex.  Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa |CITS: [17112527]|, and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of ACP.
/
/The best studied pathway is that of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12, from which all the enzymes have been purified and crystallized. In plants fatty acid synthesis occurs mainly in plastids of leaf mesophyll cells, seeds, and oil-accumulating fruits. Although most of the synthesis occurs in plastids, it has been shown that mitochondria are also capable of synthesizing fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|.
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces acetoacetyl-ACP, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequence, subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-862|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, using different combinations of its three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS). KASI, KASII and KASIII are encoded by <i>fabB</i>, <i>fabF</i> and <i>fabH</i> respectively. In general, the <i>fabH</i>-encoded enzyme is responsible for the initiation of fatty acid elongation, utilizing acyl-CoA primers, while the <i>fabB</i>/<i>fabF</i> products are responsible for the subsequent rounds of elongation, condensing malonyl-ACP with different length acyl-ACPs to extend the acyl chain by two carbons |CITS: [15952903][18384517]|.
/
/In this theoretical pathway all three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases participate. In the first reaction acetyl-CoA is transacylated to a holo-ACP by acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activity. This activity has been attributed to KASIII, although it is a minor activity of the enzyme (the trans-acylation specific activity is only about 200-fold less than the enzyme's condensation activity). It is possible that another acetyl transacylase exists in <i>E. coli</i>, although this has not been verified |CITS:[3291856][1551888]|.
/
/The product of this reaction, acetyl-ACP, can be condensed with malonyl-ACP by either KASI or KASII to form acetoacetyl-ACP. While these reactions have been verified <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [6988423] [7002930]|, the importance of this route <i>in vivo</i> is not clear, since these enzymes are believed to be primarily responsible for elongation reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/Other mechanisms for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are described in |FRAME: PWY-4381| and |FRAME: PWY-5965|.

COMMENT - This pathway shows the reactions that constitute one turn of a cycle that lengthens the chain of an acyl-ACP 
/molecule by two carbons. The pathway is fed acetoacetyl-ACP (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) 
/which  is a substrate of the second reaction shown here. The products of multiple turns of this cycle that are drawn 
/off to become components of fatty acid-containing compounds such as phospholipids, lipid A, and lipoproteins are 
/the saturated fatty acids , lauric (dodecanoic), myristic (tetradecanoic), palmitic (hexadecanoic), and stearic 
/(octadecanoic) acids. <i>E. coli </i> also contains unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed by a pathway
/(see |FRAME:PWY0-862|) that branches at the level of the 10-carbon intermediate.
/|CITS: [14527277]| |CITS: [8246839]|.
/The final step of the cycle, the reductase, once thought to be catalyzed by two enzymes, has been 
/shown to be catalyzed by a single enzyme, FabI, that can use either NADH or NADPH as a cofactor. However, the activity with NADH was over 17-fold higher than with NADPH |CITS: [9022698]|, thus the designation of the <i>E. coli</i> enzyme as EC 1.3.1.9.
/
/Of the four reactions involved in a cycle of fatty-acid elongation, two are catalyzed by more that one enzyme. These 
/function preferentially on substrates of different chain length. They also act differentially on saturated and unsaturated
/ substrates |CITS: [8910376]|. The first reaction in the sequence, the condensation reaction, is catalyzed by three 
/enzymes, FabB, FabF, and FabH. FabH initiates fatty-acid synthesis: it uses only acetyl-ACP as a substrate 
/(see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) |CITS: [14523010]|. Only FabB catalyzes one step in the synthesis 
/of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [11566998]|  The activity of FabF and hence the fraction of fatty acids that are 
/unsaturated in modultated by temperature. The distribution of the flow of synthesis that proceeds to saturated 
/vs. unsaturated fatty acids is determined by the activities of FabA and FabZ |CITS: [8910376]|.

The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid, while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex.  Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa |CITS: [17112527]|, and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of ACP.
/
/The best studied pathway is that of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12, from which all the enzymes have been purified and crystallized. In plants fatty acid synthesis occurs mainly in plastids of leaf mesophyll cells, seeds, and oil-accumulating fruits. Although most of the synthesis occurs in plastids, it has been shown that mitochondria are also capable of synthesizing fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|.
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces an acetoacetyl-ACP, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequence, subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-862|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, using different combinations of its three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS). KASI, KASII and KASIII are encoded by <i>fabB</i>, <i>fabF</i> and <i>fabH</i> respectively. In general, the <i>fabH</i>-encoded enzyme is responsible for the initiation of fatty acid elongation, utilizing acyl-CoA primers, while the <i>fabB</i>/<i>fabF</i> products are responsible for the subsequent rounds of elongation, condensing malonyl-ACP with different length acyl-ACPs to extend the acyl chain by two carbons |CITS: [15952903][18384517]|.
/
/In this theoretical pathway malonyl-ACP that has been formed by the main initiation pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-4381|) is decarboxylated to acetyl-ACP in a side reaction catalyzed by KASI, which then catalyzes a second reaction, condensing the acetyl-ACP with a second malonyl-ACP, forming acetoacetyl-ACP. While these activities have been demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[7002930][1551888][8246839]|, it is not clear if the pathway actually plays an important role <i>in vivo</i>, since these enzymes are believed to be primarily responsible for elongation reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/Other mechanisms for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are described in |FRAME: PWY-4381| and |FRAME: PWY-5966|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA.  Their diphosphates
/form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: UDP-GLUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis.  The
/pathway for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides is derived from the pathway for
/|FRAME: PWY0-162| as shown above in the pathway links.  In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage
/pathways re-utilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can
/enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY0-181| and |FRAME: PWY0-163|).  These
/essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate products of these pathways are incorporated into DNA (|FRAME: DCTP| and
/|FRAME: TTP|) and RNA (|FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP|).  The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are
/necessary in order to supply the cell with nucleoside triphosphates for stable RNA and DNA synthesis when
/precursors are limiting.  These biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate
/and reducing power.  In <i>Escherichia coli</i> they are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene
/expression level in order to conserve resources under different growth conditions.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways derive in part from the central metabolic
/precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|.  Oxaloacetate from the |FRAME: TCA|
/gives rise to the aspartate family of amino acids and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is a precursor of both pyrimidine
/ribonucleotides and nicotinamide coenzymes (see |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  The overall pathway begins
/with the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| from bicarbonate, phosphate from ATP and nitrogen from
/glutamine.  This compound then condenses with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to
/form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| as shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY0-162| and |FRAME: PWY-5686|. 
/The overall pathway branches at |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is an intermediate in |FRAME: ARG|
/biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY|).  The activated intermediate |FRAME: PRPP| is derived from
/|FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and is a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> and salvage pathways for pyrimidine and purine
/nucleotides, as well as in biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide coenzymes, |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP|
/(see |FRAME: PRPP-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY0-662| and |FRAME: PWY0-661|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates the point at which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CDP|, |FRAME: CTP|,
/|FRAME: UDP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and the
/DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed.  Deoxyribonucleotides are
/synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides, which is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
/that carries out reduction at the C2' position.  This enzyme has a central role in DNA replication and repair. 
/In <i>E. coli</i> this ribo- to deoxyribo- conversion is catalyzed by aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, or
/anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase.  Electrons for these reductions are derived
/from |FRAME: NADPH| and are transferred via |FRAME: Red-Thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|,
/or |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins|.
/
/The ribonucleotide reductase product of genes |FRAME: EG10660| and |FRAME: EG10661| functions aerobically
/and under microaerophilic conditions.  A normally cryptic enzyme encoded by genes |FRAME: EG20257|
/and |FRAME: EG12381| cannot support aerobic, or microaerophilic growth in a <i>nrdAB</i> deletion mutant. 
/However, it supports aerobic growth in such a mutant when genes <i>nrdHIEF</i> are overexpressed on a
/plasmid |CITS: [16771665]|.  It has been speculated that this additional aerobic enzyme may enhance
/ribonucleotide reductase activity under conditions of oxidative stress.  The anaerobic enzyme is encoded by
/gene |FRAME: EG11417| which functions in a multienzyme complex with the products of genes |FRAME: G812|
/and |FRAME: EG10628|.  Pathways for the reduction of these reductase enzymes have also been studied
/|CITS: [16771665]|.
/
/The major pathway for the aerobic, <i>de novo</i> formation of the intermediate |FRAME: DUMP|, the immediate
/precursor of thymine-containing nucleotides, is via phosphorylation of |FRAME: DCDP|
/to |FRAME: DCTP| and deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUTP| which is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: DUMP|. 
/This pathway supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.  Most of the remainder is presumed to
/be formed from |FRAME: DUDP|, as shown.  In <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: EG11418|, |FRAME: EG10219| mutants, an
/alternate <i>de novo</i> deoxycytidine pathway to |FRAME: DUMP| is used that relies on salvage enzymes
/|CITS: [17827303]|.  Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of
/|FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by
/|FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX|.  Two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is
/catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the product
/of gene |FRAME: EG10650| which also catalyzes two preceding reactions.

COMMON-NAME - peptidoglycan biosynthesis I (<I>meso</I>-diaminopimelate containing)
CITATIONS - 18081839:EV-EXP-TAS:3639708592:amackie
COMMENT - Peptidoglycan is a net-like polymer which surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane of most bacteria and functions to maintain cell shape and prevent rupture due to the internal turgor. The peptidoglycan of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 consists of glycan strands of alternating subunits of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) which are cross-linked by short peptides (|CITS: [14150645][4975910]| and see review by |CITS: [4568761]|. Synthesis of peptidoglycan is a complex two-part process which occurs across two cell compartments. The first part, assembly of a disaccharide-peptide monomer takes place in the cytoplasm and at the inner face of the inner membrane and is described in this pathway. The monomer unit is then flipped to the outer face of the inner membrane where the polymerisation and binding reactions take place (see |FRAME: PWY0-1586|).
/
/The first 6 steps of the pathway describe the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide (a nucleotide activated monosaccharide-peptide) from the essential peptidoglycan precursor UDP-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine. The pentapeptide stem is attached to the lactyl group of MurNAc and contains rare D-amino acids. In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 the newly synthesized pentapeptide is formed by successive addition of L-alanine, D-glutamate, <i>meso</i>-diaminopimelic acid (m-A<sub>2</sub>pm) and a D-alanyl-alanine dipeptide catalysed by the MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF ligases respectively (see |FRAME: PWY-6387| for more detail).
/
/To facilitate translocation across the inner membrane the peptidoglycan precursor molecules are attached to the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate which is synthesized <i>de novo</i> in the cytoplasm and partitioned into the inner face of the inner membrane (see |FRAME: PWY-5785|); it is also recycled as peptidoglycan is assembled in the periplasm. The enzyme MraY catalyses the reversible transfer of a phosphoMurNAc-pentapeptide from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide to undecaprenyl phosphate in the membrane to form undecaprenyldiphospho-<i>N</i>-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-<I>meso</I>-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (also known as Lipid I) plus UMP |CITS: [1846850]|. This is followed by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to form the disaccharide-pentapeptide monomer (<i>ditrans,octacis</i>-undecaprenyldiphospho-<i>N</i>-acetyl-(<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl)muramoyl-L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-<I>meso</I>-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or Lipid II) - a reaction catalysed by the MurG enzyme |CITS:[1649817],[8449890]|. Lipid II, which is the building block for mature peptidoglycan is then flipped across the inner membrane by an inner membrane flippase - two independent proteins, |FRAME: EG10344-MONOMER "FtsW"| |CITS: [21386816][24711460]| and |FRAME: G6561-MONOMER "MurJ"| |CITS: [25013077][18832143][18708495]| have been implicated in this process.

TYPES - Super-Pathways
COMMON-NAME - superpathway of histidine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis
COMMENT - <b>About This Superpathway: What is the Connection Between the Biosynthesis of Histidine and Nucleotides?</b>
/
/Pyrimidine, purine, and pyridine nucleotide synthesis all require phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) as a precursor.  PRPP is utilized by both the <i>de novo</i> pathways and the auxiliary or salvage pathways by which endogenously formed or exogenously added pyrimidine, purine, or pyridine bases are converted to the corresponding ribonucleoside monophosphates by phosphoribosyltransferases.  PRPP is also used in the histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways.  PRPP thus may be regarded as a precursor for the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and for the NAD(P) coenzymes.  The formation of PRPP therefore is subjected to strict metabolic control. |CITS: [3009477]|
/
/It is noteworthy that histidine biosynthesis consumes adenylate in the form of ATP and removes atoms from the purine moiety.  Thus adenylate is destroyed.
/
/Histidine biosynthesis has been most thoroughly studied in Salmonella, though several studies from <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i> support the interaction between the <i>his</i> and <i>pur</i> pathways:
/
/The byproduct of the HisHF reaction is |FRAME: AICAR| (AICAR), a late purine biosynthetic intermediate that in two steps is converted to IMP. In two more reaction steps, AMP is regenerated.
/
/<b>Mutational, nutritional, inhibitor, biochemical and transcriptomic analyses indicatiing the benefit of histidine pathway-derived AICAR's conversion to ATP.</b> Growth of many histidine auxotrophs of <i>Salmonella</i> can also be rescued by adenine; such mutations have been found in the third (HisI), fourth(HisA), fifth (HisH, HisF), sixth and eighth (HisB)and seventh (HisC) reactions. |CITS: [14400144][14400143][387516][HARTMAN56]|. These mutations are not polar since the first two steps of histidine bioynthesis (sequential formation of PR-ATP and hydrolysis of this product to PR-AMP and PP<sub>i</sub>) appear to be required for adenylate sequestration within the truncated pathway.
/
/Growth of a leaky <i>hisF</i> mutant of <i>E. coli</i> B/r lacking HisHF activity is rescued by adenine; growth on this supplement results in <i>his</i> operon over-expression |CITS: [13977022][13977021]|.
/
/Addition of acivicin, a specific HisHF inhibitor (<i>K<sub>i</sub></i> =140 nM), to growing <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [11344143]| causes both <i>his</i> operon and <i>purA</i> derepression.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamine diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism.  It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, pyruvate decarboxylase, and &alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase |CITS:[15326535]|.  Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran.  Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamine-containing husk |CITS: [8710215]|.  Thiamine is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Since the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is a very complex process, many organisms possess various salvage pathways that enable them to rescue thiamine fragments obtained from the environment.  This pathway describes the salvage of two thiamine degradation compounds, |FRAME: THZ| and |FRAME: HMP| (HMP).
/
/The key enzyme of the pathway is |FRAME: THZ-KIN-MONOMER|, an enzyme that phosphorylates the degradation product |FRAME: THZ|, turning it into the phosphorylated form that it a part of the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway.
/
/HMP is processed by |FRAME: HMP-P-KIN-CPLX ThiD|, a bifunctional enzyme that also takes part in the biosynthetic pathway.  The enzyme phosphorylates HMP into |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P|, already an intermediate of the biosynthetic pathway, and continues to add another phosphate, resulting in |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|, the other substrate of |FRAME: THIE-MONOMER|.
/
/The rest of the pathway is identical to the biosynthetic pathway: |FRAME: THIE-MONOMER| catalyzes the coupling of the thiazole and pyrimidine moieties, while |FRAME: THI-P-KIN-MONOMER| adds another phosphate group, generating the active form |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3656714038:keseler
COMMENT - <b>About this Superpathway</b>
/
/A number of shared enzymes connect the biosynthesis pathways for the three branched chain amino acids L-leucine, L-isoleucine and L-valine. How the cell regulates these pathways to produce branched chain amino acids in the required amounts has presented a challenging puzzle.
/
/<b>Pathway Architecture and Feedback Inhibition.</b> The isoleucine and valine pathways carry out homologous reactions catalyzed by an acetolactate synthase (ALS), a ketol acid reductoisomerase, a dihydroxyacid dehydratase and a transaminase. The first enzyme of isoleucine synthesis, |FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-MONOMER threonine deaminase|, liberates |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| which is condensed by ALS with pyruvate to form |FRAME: 2-ACETO-2-HYDROXY-BUTYRATE|. From |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, the last intermediate in the valine pathway, the biosynthesis of leucine and pantothenate commences. As expected, the first enzyme of isoleucine biosynthesis and the first enzyme of leucine biosynthesis are allosterically inhibited by the respective pathway end-products. Flux to pantothenate is quantitatively insignificant; thus it may not be so surprising that feedback inhbition of this pathway is not at the first step of pantothenate synthesis but rather at the much later pantothenate kinase reaction whose inhibition spares energy in the form of ATP |CITS: [2842294]|. Thus control of flux by allosteric inhibition is straightforward for the superpathway except for control of ALS activity.
/
/<b>Multiple ALS Isozymes.</b> In <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i>, three operons each specify a heteromeric ALS. <i>ilvBN</i> specifies ALS I, <i>ilvGM</i>of the <i>ilvGMEDA</i> operon encodes ALS II, and <i>ilvIH</i> are the structural genes for ALS III.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 ALS II is inactive due to a frameshift mutation in <i>ilvG</i>, that has polarity effects upon downstream operon gene expression |CITS: [3315862]|, while a mutation in the LT2 strain of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> prevents production of an active ALS III |CITS: [7557326]|. Other <i>E. coli</i> strains (e.g. the B strain) express a functional ALS II |CITS: [22632713]|, while natural <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> isolates express ALS III. Thus it is believed that all three enzymes of ALS were expressed in the initial K-12 and LT2 isolates; domestication of these model organisms led to inactivation of <i>ilvG</i> and <i>ilvIH</i>.
/
/<b>ALS Isozyme Specificities.</b> A specificity parameter R has been used to characterize the abilities of isozymes to contribute to acetolactate and acetohydroxybutyrate formation. R is defined as the velocity of acetohydroxybutyrate x [pyruvate] x (velocity of acetolactae formation x [2-ketobutyrate])<sup>-1</sup>. Note that in cells growing on glucose the concentration of pyruvate exceeds that of 2-ketobutyrate by a factor of about 100. |CITS: [3301814]|
/
/The R parameter for ALS I is 1 indicating that ALS I predominantly (>98%) makes acetolactate rather than acetohydroxybutyrate <i>in vivo</i>. |CITS: [3301814]| Thus ALS I can be considered a mono-functional isozyme that is under normal physiological conditions only capable of acetolactate synthesis required in the path to valine (as well as leucine and pantothenate), while ALS II and ALS III are bifunctional enzymes capable of making both acetohydroxybutyrate and acetolactate leading to, respectively, isoleucine and the troika of valine, leucine and pantothenate |CITS: [26443574]|. 
/
/<b>Allosteric Inhibition of ALS Isozymes.</b> ALS I and III are feedback inhibited in an allosteric manner by valine. ALS II however is not subject to feedback inhibition. The lack of feedback inhibition and bi-functionality in both acetolactate and acetohydroxybutyrate synthesis suggests that ALS II can be considered the second, feedback insensitive enzyme of the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway while also contributing to valine synthesis; a parallel argument suggests that  ALS I is the mono-functional first enzyme specific to valine synthesis and hence subject to allosteric inhibition by the end-product valine.
/
/<b>Varied transcriptional control of ALS isozyme formation.</b> This has been reviewed. |CITS: [26443574]| ALS I transcription is controlled by attenuation; its leader peptide is MTTSMLNAKLLPTAPSAAVVVVRVVVVVGNAP. This peptide contains L and V but not I; thus valyl- and leucyl-tRNA control ALS I expression. This is consistent with the physiological role of ALS I being to supply acetolactate but not acetohydroxybutyrate. 
/
/The <i>ilvGMEDA</i> operon has long been known to be controlled by the levels of all three branched chain amino acids, a control originally termed multivalent repression. The means of this control was clarified; this operon's transcription is controlled by a classic attentuation mechanism. The leader peptide involved in attenuation of the ALS II-specifying <i>ilvGMEDA</i> operon is MTALLRVISLVVISVVVIIIPPCGAALGRGKA; note that the attenuation leader peptide synthesis is dependent upon valyl-, leucyl- and isoleucyl-tRNA, emphasizing the roles of the <i>ilvGMEDA</i> operon gene products in flux to all three branched chain amino acids.
/
/ALS III transcription is subject to control by the global regulator LRP, the leucine regulatory protein. LRP activates <i>ilvIH</i> transcription; leucine antagonizes LRP's ability to activate expression of this operon. Here, the specific control by leucine is at odds with the isozyme's ability to support vigorous production of all three branched chain amino acids. Perhaps this supports the thought that LRP is a sensor of overall nutritional status via its interaction with the amino acids leucine and alanine.

UNIQUE-ID - SULFATE-CYS-PWY
TYPES - Super-Pathways
COMMON-NAME - superpathway of sulfate assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis
COMMENT - Production of L-cysteine rerequires formation of sulfide from sulfate and <i>O</i>--acetyl-L-serine from L-serine.  
/
/3'-Phospho-adenylylsulfate reductase (CysH) is involved in the assimilation of sulfate and catalyzes the reduction of 3'-phospho-adenylylsulfate (PAPS) to sulfite and PAP(adenosine-3',5'-<i>bis</i>--phosphate). As a consequence of this and a subsequent reaction ATP, a high energy adenylate, removed from the cytoplam at the initiation of the cysteine biosynthetic pathway, is returned as the low energy adenylate, AMP.
/
/<b>Mutational studies indicative of significant adenylate sequestration potential within the cysteine biosynthetic pathway.</b> Sulfate assimilation proceeds by the consecutive steps of its import (encoded by <i>cysA</i>), adenylation (encoded by <i>cysD, cysN</i>), and phosphorylation (encoded by <i>cysC</i>), prior to sulfate reduction to sulfite coupled to its release (encoded by <i>cysH</i>).  A byproduct of sulfite formation is adenosine-3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate. 
/
/A compromised cysteine biosynthetic pathway can drain adenylate from a cell as initially demonstrated in <i>Salmonella</i> |CITS: [4884730]|.  <i>Salmonella cysH </i> mutants, expected to accumulate adenosine-3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate, pick up a secondary mutational block in any of the earlier <i>cys</i> pathway steps (enocded by <i>cysA, cysD, cysC</i>) upon prolonged storage as slant cultures.  CysH encodes 3'-phospho-adenylylsulfate reductase that releases sulfite and PAP (adenosine-3,5-<i>bis</i>-phosphate). Like in the case of histidine biosynthesis, an adenylate drain can be caused if there is not an efficient means to return the substrate PAPS (adenosine-3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate) to the adenylate (ATP, ADP, AMP) pool. Such a reaction, PAP to AMP + Pi, is carried out by adenosine-3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase encoded by <i>cysQ</i> in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [16682444]|. Loss of CysQ activity leads to lithium hypersensitivity and accumulation of PAP <i>in vitro</i>; in addition multicopy <i>cysQ</i> constructs display enhanced lithium resistance |CITS: [16682444]|. PAP is a competitive, low &micro;M inhibitor of CysH |CITS: [7588765]|.
/
/Moreover, in <i>E. coli</i> about 10% of low level, nalidixic acid resistant transposon insertion mutations cause auxotrophy and reside in either <i>cysH, icdA, metE</i> or <i>purB</i> |CITS: [12057966]|. It has been suggested that expulsion of substrates (homocysteine in the <i>metE</i> mutant; PAPS in the <i>cysH</i> mutant; isocitrate in the <i>icdA</i> mutant; SAICAR in the <i>purB</i> mutant) is required for low level drug resistance since a functional AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is needed for this phenotype. In fact, these auxotrophic mutants induce synthesis of AcrAB. Perhaps several means to accomplish an adenylate drain exist. Thus in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> evidence is found that the accumulation of PAPS is detrimental to the cell, most possibly through the drain of adenylate from the system.

COMMENT - Lipid A is the hydrophobic anchor of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide. Free lipid A does not exist as such in cells. It is normally found glycosylated with two KDO (3-deoxy-D-<I>manno</I>-octulosonic acid) residues and acylated with laurate and myristate residues. 
/
/However if cells are subjected to cold shock or grown at low temperatures the laurate residue is replaced by palmitoleate. Myristate is subsequently added, resulting in a distinct cold adapted form of KDO<SUB>2</SUB>-lipid A. |CITS: [ColiSalII] [8662613] [2203778] [9099672] [10092655]|

The catalytic site localizes to the exterior of the outer membrane, indicating that enzyme activity may require outer membrane problems that result in mislocalization of palmitate-donor phospholipids from the interior face to the exterior face of the outer membrane |CITS: [12357033]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine
/dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell. 
/Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions.  Because
/of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these compounds
/are often depicted as NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, respectively.
/
/Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms.  In reactions where
/NAD or NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate.  During the
/reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> (or NADP<sup>+</sup>), the molecule acquires two electrons and one
/proton, while the second proton is released into the medium.  Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in
/the form:
/
/NAD<sup>+</sup> + 2H -> NADH + H<sup>+</sup>
/
/NAD is synthesized via two major pathway families in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the
/<i>de novo</i> pathway, and the salvage pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate <i>de novo</i> pathway, in which the nicotinate
/moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate |CITS: [11153263]|, while in eukaryotes, the <i>de novo</i>
/pathway starts with tryptophan |CITS: [12062417]| (|FRAME: NADSYN-PWY|).
/
/The first attempt to elucidate a prokaryotic pathway to NAD was reported by Ortega and Brown in 1960
/|CITS: [13731310]|. They implicated (incorrectly) glycerol and a dicarboxylic acid as precursors in the
/synthesis of the pyridine ring of NAD in <i>E. coli</i>.  Subsequent work by Chandler et al.
/|CITS: [4321550]| established that L-aspartate is the dicarboxylic acid precursor.  Suzuki et al., in 1973,
/established that the three carbon precursor is dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and not glycerol
/|CITS: [4351074]|.  In addition, Andreoli et al. demonstrated that quinolinate was a key intermediate in this
/pathway |CITS: [14013029]|.  Eventually it became clear that quinolinate is indeed a precursor, not only in
/this pathway, but in all known NAD biosynthetic pathways.

COMMON-NAME - NAD salvage pathway I
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3372700043:keseler
COMMENT - Even though NAD molecules are not consumed during oxidation reactions, they have a relatively short half-life.
/For example, in <i>E. coli</i> the NAD<sup>+</sup> half-life is 90 minutes. Once enzymatically degraded, the
/pyrimidine moiety of the molecule can be recouped via the NAD salvage cycles.
/This pathway is used for two purposes: it recycles the internally degraded NAD products
/nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide (also known as nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN) and nicotinamide, and it is
/used for the assimilation of exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup>.
/
/Since the NAD<sup>+</sup> molecule is highly polar,
/it has to be hydrolyzed before it can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane for final uptake. It does seem
/to be able to penetrate the external membrane, though, as the enzymes that break it down are found in the periplasm
/|CITS: [2841298]|.  NAD<sup>+</sup> is first hydrolyzed by NAD pyrophosphatase into NMN , which can be
/hydrolyzed further to nicotinamide by NMN nucleosidase. Both enzymes are periplasmic.
/Both NMN and nicotinamide can be transported across the inner membrane into
/the cytoplasm. Once there, nicotinamide is converted via nicotinate to nicotinate nucleotide, at which point the
/pathway merges with the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway, and continues to NAD via deamido-NAD.
/
/There are several flavors of the salvage pathway found in different organisms, and even within the same organism.
/The one described above contains 6 reaction steps, and is often referred to as the PNC VI pathway, for Pyridine
/Nucleotide Cycling. However, there are also a four-step cycle and a five-step cycle, termed PNC IV and V, 
/respectively |CITS: [220211][6445894]|. 
/In the PNC IV cycle, the enzyme NMN amidohydrolase (also called NMN deamidase) converts NMN (which can be
/transported across the inner membrane in Enterobacteria) directly to nicotinate nucleotide, bypassing the enzymes
/nicotinamidase (PncA) and nicotine phosphoribosyl transferase (PncB), which are members of the PNC VI cycle.
/PNC IV is the major intracellular recycling pathway in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [7021549]|, while PNC VI is the major cycle
/of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> |CITS: [6445894]|.

COMMENT - In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of de novo purine biosynthetic genes

/there are 14 reactions involved in the de novo synthesis of AMP and GMP and these are controlled 
/by 12 known genes. The genes occur mostly as unlinked single units or as small functional operons 
/carrying two or, at the most, three structural genes each.  The purR gene encodes a repressor 
/controlling the synthesis of the enzymes or purine biosynthesis.  Sequences similar to the protected 
/region (PUR box) in purF are present in the regulatory regions of purMN.  The expression of purR 
/was shown to be autoregulated, probably through blocking of transcription elongation by binding 
/of PurR to the two PUR boxes.  So far, six genes/operons have been reported to contain PUR box-like 
/sequences.  The purine biosynthetic pathway is controlled by feedback regulation of activity as 
/well as at the level of transcription.|CITS:[2404765]|

/Reactions that convert ADP to ATP are found in multiple pathways, including fueling pathways such 
/as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>

/Proline, a cyclic amino acid, is one of the basic building blocks of proteins.  In addition, proline has other important functions.  It acts as an osmoprotectant in bacteria |CITS: [1741624]|, plants |CITS: [Delauney93]| and animals |CITS: [16043587]|, protecting cells from osmotic stress; it participates in free radical scavenging |CITS: [18167531]|; and it can serve as a source of carbon and nitrogen |CITS: [3072423]|.  Microorganisms, plants, and animals synthesize L-proline from L-glutamate in three steps as shown in this pathway.  While plants |CITS: [1384052]| and animals |CITS: [10037775][8761662]| employ a single bi-functional enzyme to catalyze the first two steps, in bacteria they are carried out by two independent mono-functional enzymes.  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of L-proline in <i>E. coli</i> involves the reduction of L-glutamate to glutamate semialdehyde in two consecutive enzymatic steps.  This is followed by a spontaneous dehydration step in which L-glutamate &gamma;-semialdehyde is converted into its cyclic derivative, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which is subsequently reduced to L-proline.  The first reaction in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: GLUTKIN-CPLX| |CITS: [6319365]|.  The second reaction, NADPH-dependent reduction of &gamma;-glutamyl phosphate to glutamate-5-semialdehyde, is catalyzed by |FRAME: GLUTSEMIALDEHYDROG-CPLX| |CITS: [6337636]|.  Although |FRAME: GLUTKIN-CPLX| activity produces the unstable intermediate |FRAME: L-GLUTAMATE-5-P|, suggesting the formation of a complex to channel this compound to |FRAME: GLUTSEMIALDEHYDROG-CPLX| |CITS: [4152574]|, a stable complex between G5K and ProA could not be isolated |CITS: [6319365]|.  The final step in the pathway, the reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to L-proline, is catalyzed by the NADPH-dependent |FRAME: PYRROLINECARBREDUCT-CPLX| |CITS: [6296787]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME:ALLANTOIN "Allantoin"| is a common product of purine degradation.  Allantoin is rich in nitrogen, and many organisms are able to degrade and recycle it.  Some bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-1458|, |FRAME: TAX-80866| and |FRAME: TAX-264198|, do so under aerobic conditions, while others such as |FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: ORG-5985| and |FRAME: TAX-587| do so only anaerobically.
/
/Allantoin degradation is not limited to bacteria.  Ureide-transporting plants convert fixed nitrogen in their roots to |FRAME:ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|, which are then transported to upper parts of the plant, where they are degraded to release the nitrogen.  In addition, some fungi and animals also degrade allantoin.

/The first step of the pathway, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-64|, comprises the hydrolysis of the internal amide bond of |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN|, forming |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| |CITS: [786256]|.  This enzyme turned out to be common to all organisms that can degrade allantoin, and is the first step in all allantoin degradation pathways.
/
/|FRAME: ALLANTOATE "Allantoate"| is converted to |FRAME: CPD0-2298| via one of two routes.  In the first route, the nitrogen is liberated in a single step in the form of |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: ALLANTOICASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.4"|), while in the other route it is liberated in the form of |FRAME: AMMONIA| in two steps, via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD0-2298| (starting with |FRAME: ALLANTOATE-DEIMINASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.9"|).
/
/The next step in the pathway is the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-1091| to |FRAME: GLYOX|.  Similarly, this conversion can proceed with the liberation of either |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-LYASE-RXN "EC 4.3.2.3"|) or |FRAME: AMMONIA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-HYDROLASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.19"|).
/
/Several combinations of these routes have been documented.  Some organisms possess pathways that produce solely |FRAME: UREA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5694|), some produce only |FRAME: AMMONIA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5692|), and some produce both (see |FRAME: PWY-5705|).  In addition, some anaerobic organisms can degrade allantoin to |FRAME: CPD-389| instead of |FRAME: GLYOX| (see |FRAME: PWY0-41|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this hybrid pathway |FRAME: CPLX-7524| and |FRAME: G6284-MONOMER| catalyze the first two deamination steps, producing |FRAME: CPD-1091| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|, while |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| gives rise to |FRAME:GLYOX| and |FRAME: UREA|.  Glyoxylate could then enter general metabolism, where it would be converted by the successive action of three enzymes to 3-phosphoglycerate, feeding into |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS| (see |FRAME: GLYCOLATEMET-PWY|).  However, this route would imply that allantoin <b>can</b> serve as a sole source of carbon for <i>E. coli</i>, which it can not.  It has been speculated that this pathway is not utilized in <i>E. coli</i> due to the low expression of |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| |CITS: [19935661]|.  Additionally, |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| is poorly characterized.

COMMENT - <i>Escherichia coli</i> uses gluconeogenesis to synthesize glucose 6-phosphate from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates when sufficient amounts of exogenous glucose or other sugars are unavailable for transport into the cell. Carbon sources for gluconeogenesis include 3-carbon compounds such as pyruvate, (<i>S</i>)-lactate and glycerol, or intermediates of the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"| such as (<i>S</i>)-malate, and oxaloacetate. The glucose 6-phosphate end product of gluconeogenesis is a precursor of glycogen and various sugars used in the biosynthesis of cell surface structures. Several important intermediates synthesized during gluconeogenesis, fructose 6-phosphate phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP) and 3-phosphoglycerate, also serve as biosynthetic precursors. For example see pathways |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|, |FRAME: UDPNAGSYN-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-6164|, and |FRAME: SERSYN-PWY|.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> the gluconeogenesis pathway is essentially a reversal of glycolysis and requires energy input in the form of ATP and NADH(H<sup>+</sup>) to produce the 6-carbon molecule glucose 6-phosphate from 3- or 4-carbon precursors. During gluconeogenesis two enzyme activities catalyze irreversible reactions that enable the glycolysis pathway to flow in the opposite direction to produce glucose 6-phosphate. These uniquely gluconeogenic enzymes are fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase EC 3.1.3.11, and pyruvate, water dikinase (also known as PEP synthetase) EC 2.7.9.2. Their unidirectionally opposite counterparts in the glycolysis pathway are 6-phosphofructokinase EC 2.7.1.11 and pyruvate kinase EC 2.7.1.40, respectively (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS|).
/
/The gluconeogenesis pathway enzymes fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and PEP synthetase, along with PEP carboxykinase and the malic enzymes encoded by <i>maeA</i> and <i>maeB</i>, catalyze anaplerotic reactions, defined as those that replenish pools of metabolic intermediates. The first committed step of gluconeogenesis is the formation of PEP. This is catalyzed by PEP carboxykinase encoded by <i>pck</i>, or PEP synthetase encoded by <i>ppsA</i>, both in physiologically unidirectional reactions. These enzymes exert control over gluconeogenic growth on different carbon sources |CITS: [8226637]|.
/
/To meet the cell's energy needs under various conditions, coordinate regulation of gluconeogeneis and glycolysis is necessary |CITS: [12655459]|. For example, at the protein level the presence of pyruvate protects PEP synthetase from inactivation by regulatory protein |FRAME: CPLX0-7837 "PSRP"| |CITS: [20044937]|. The fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase isozyme encoded by <i>fbp</i> is allosterically regulated, being activated by PEP and inhibited by AMP |CITS: [16670087]|. At the transcriptional level genes <i>glpX, yggF, ppsA, pck</i> and <i>glk</i> have been identified as targets for the transcription factor |FRAME: PC00004 "CRP"| which is activated by cAMP in the absence of glucose and has a major role in the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis |CITS: [21673794]|. The carbon storage regulator |FRAME: CPLX0-7956 "CsrA"| was found to exert reciprocal effects on glycolysis which is positively regulated, versus gluconeogenesis and glycogen biosynthesis which are negatively regulated by this protein |CITS: [7493933]|.

COMMON-NAME - ppGpp biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The nucleotides ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism |CITS: [18039766] [18430135]|.  In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|.
/
/Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.  It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence.  Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of ppGpp analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new <i>in vitro</i> synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for ppGpp.  Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered.  Even in the well-studied <i>Escherichia coli</i> many details of ppGpp action remain to be elucidated.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.
/
/In the <i>E. coli</i> stringent response transcription, translation and DNA replication are affected by (p)ppGpp levels.  Transcription is redirected from genes related to growth to genes involved in survival under starvation and stress conditions.  The regulation of transcription by (p)ppGpp occurs at the transcription initiation stage and affects promoter use.  However, the mechanism remains unclear and direct and indirect models for regulation have been proposed.  It has been shown that ppGpp and a cofactor protein DksA bind to RNA polymerase and modulate its activity at promoters |CITS: [15294157] [15899978]|, although the exact ppGpp binding site(s) responsible for regulation are undefined |CITS: [18272182]|.  Transcription of many &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-dependent genes and genes dependent upon alternative sigma factors is negatively or positively regulated by ppGpp.  
/
/In direct models for regulation, ppGpp affects the RNA polymerase (RNAP)-promoter interaction via stabilization, or destabilization of the RNAP-promoter open complex.  ppGpp allosterically constrains RNAP movements, thereby preventing the DNA-protein contacts that stabilize the open complex |CITS:[25916853]|. Indirect models include changes in the availability of RNA polymerase, and a role for ppGpp in regulating differential binding of sigma factors to core RNA polymerase.  Transcriptional alterations resulting from these mechanisms include repression of tRNA and rRNA synthesis (a key event in limiting the growth rate), induction of stress response factors, and induction of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport.  Reviewed in |CITS: [16554711] [15686546] [18359660]|.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> the regulation of translation by (p)ppGpp involves its repression of transcription of rRNA, tRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as its interaction with initiation factor IF2 and possibly with elongation factors.  The regulation of DNA replication by (p)ppGpp in <i>E. coli</i> involves inhibition of the initiation step.  The demonstration that the <i>E. coli</i> DnaG primase is inhibited by ppGpp <i>in vitro</i> also suggests inhibition of the elongation step |CITS: [19945481]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18359660]|.
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the products of genes <i>relA</i> and <i>spoT</i> have prominent roles in (p)ppGpp metabolism.  This was shown by the absence of ppGpp in <i>relA</i>/<i>spoT</i> null mutants under stringent conditions |CITS: [2005134]|.  RelA functions as a synthetase and SpoT mainly as a hydrolase, although it also has synthetase activity.  Regulation of these opposing activities is critical for the ability of bacteria to respond to nutritional stress and to avoid a futile cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp..  Homologous variants of the RelA and SpoT genes encoding Rsh proteins (Rel Spo homologs) are found in some bacteria and plants.  The &beta;- and &gamma;-proteobacteria have proteins homologous to RelA and SpoT, while most other bacteria have a bifunctional protein designated Rel.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629]|.
/
/Experiments have shown that regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by RelA in response to amino acid starvation occurs at the level of translation on the ribosome.  Ribosome-associated RelA produces ppGpp in response to the presence of uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal A-site which results in a stalled ribosome.  Regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by SpoT is less well understood, but involves sensing other sources of nutrient stress, such as a limitation in fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [17078815]|.  SpoT also senses phosphate starvation |CITS: [17640895]| and iron limitation |CITS: [15853883]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [16554711]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here for the biosynthesis and metabolism of (p)ppGpp is based upon that shown in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see reference below) except as noted.  Early kinetic studies established the overall pathway of ppGpp metabolism.  The first product of the stringent response to amino acid starvation is pppGpp which is quickly converted to the more stable compound ppGpp.  ppGpp is then hydrolyzed to GDP |CITS: [782536] [321933]|.  A role for a kinase in converting GDP back to GTP to complete a cycle was proposed early (in |CITS: [321933] [365225]|) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, the product of gene <i>ndk</i>, was suggested as a likely candidate.  This was supported by mutant studies in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>) although there is no direct evidence for a unique effect of Ndk on (p)ppGpp levels in <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. typhimurium</i> (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).
/
/RelA can catalyze the conversion of both GTP to pppGpp, and GDP to ppGpp with similar <i>S</i><sub>0.5</sub> values derived from the Hill equation.  These values are well below the intracellular pool concentrations of GTP and ATP, but are similar to the intracellular pool concentration of GDP |CITS: [3015258]|.  Therefore pppGpp is probably the main RelA product, although both reactions are shown here (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  In addition to a synthetase (PSI) domain, RelA also contains an inactive hydrolase domain (in |CITS: [18454629]|).  RelA is responsible for ppGpp synthesis during the stringent response to amino acid starvation.
/
/<i>In vivo</i> pppGpp is rapidly converted to ppGpp by Gpp (reviewed in |CITS: [15590778]|).  It is the major route of pppGpp degradation, although minor routes via enzymes with similar activity may also exist (Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).
/
/SpoT is a bifunctional enzyme with both a hydrolase activity and a weak synthetase activity (designated PSII) |CITS: [2005135] [8730877]|.  The SpoT ppGpp hydrolase activity is inhibited under conditions of physiological stress and has a major role in ppGpp degradation.  The role of the SpoT synthetase (PSII) activity is less clear.  It has been proposed to have a role in maintaining the basal level of ppGpp during exponential growth (in |CITS: [8648647]|).  SpoT also has pppGpp hydrolase activity |CITS: [365225]| and possibly pppGpp synthetase activity.  The putative SpoT pppGpp synthetase activity is based on mutant phenotype.  In &Delta;<i>relA</i>/&Delta;<i>gpp</i> mutants starved for glucose pppGpp accumulates which suggests phosphoryl group transfer to GTP as well as GDP, although the phsophoryl donor is not known (cited as unpublished data in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  This reaction is not shown here.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The name trehalose was introduced in 1858 to describe a main constituent of shells that are secreted by various insects on tree leaves in the middle east.  These shells were often dried and used as a sweetening agent, and are believed to be related to the biblical Manna, the food supplied to the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness of Arabia.  One variety of these shells, produced by the beetles <i>Larinus maculatus</i> and <i>Larinus nidificans</i>, was called "trehala manna", and the sugar extracted from it was named trehalique glucose, or trehalose |CITS: [12065209]|.  In fact, trehalose is a disaccharide that is ubiquitous in the biosphere.  It consists of two subunits of glucose bound by an &alpha;:1-1 linkage (&alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl &alpha;-D-glucopyranoside) and is thus nonreducing.  Trehalose has been isolated and characterized from many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, insects and mammals |CITS: [11081789]| (and original references described therein). 
/
/In addition to being nonreducing, trehalose possesses several unique properties, including high hydrophilicity, chemical stability, nonhygroscopic glass formation and no internal hydrogen bond formation.  The combination of these features explains the principal role of trehalose as a stress metabolite.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Under conditions of elevated osmotic strength, <i>E. coli</i> can regulate the osmotic strength of the cytoplasm by accumulating K<sup>+</sup> ions and some organic molecules, commonly called osmoprotectants or compatible solutes.  The preferred osmoprotectant of <i>E. coli</i> is glycine betaine.  However, its synthesis relies on an external supply of proline, betaines, or choline.  When these compounds are not available, a cell can achieve a moderate level of osmotic tolerance by accumulation of glutamate and trehalose |CITS: [1825082]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> synthesizes and accumulates trehalose when exposed to osmotic stress |CITS: [2883950]| and low temperatures |CITS: [12105274]|.  It is synthesized from UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate via trehalose-6-phosphate, by the action of two enzymes, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase.  Expression of both genes encoding the two enzymes, <i>otsA</i> and <i>otsB</i>, is osmotically regulated.  Transcription from these genes increases during osmotic stress |CITS: [3131312]| and cold shock |CITS: [12105274]| and when the cells enter stationary phase, and requires the stress sigma factor RpoS |CITS: [1744047]|.  Synthesis of trehalose is also stimulated directly by K<sup>+</sup> ion-dependent activation of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase enzyme |CITS: [3131312]|.
/
/Under osmotic stress, <i>E. coli</i> overproduces trehalose, some of which is excreted to the periplasmic space.  Once there, it is degraded by the periplasmic trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182|).  This process was named "a futile cycle for controlling the cytoplasmic level of trehalose" |CITS: [1825082]|.

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Several metabolic pathways for putrescine degradation as a source of nitrogen for <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are known. The first  putrescine degradation pathway was found in in 1985 |CITS:[3897201]| (see |FRAME:PUTDEG-PWY |).  That pathway is dedicated to the degradation of intracellular putrescine. A second pathway was found in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 twenty years later.  This pathway seems to be dedicated to the degradation of extracellular putrescine |CITS: [15590624]|.
/
/The pathway was discovered following the discovery of a cluster of seven unassigned genes on the <i>E. coli</i> K-12 chromosome.  In addition to a putrescine transporter, encoded by the <i>puuP</i> gene, the cluster contains four genes that encode the enzymes involved in this pathway, and two additional genes (<i>puuE</i> and <i>puuR</i>) that encode an enzyme involved in the catabolism of GABA (see |FRAME: 4AMINOBUTMETAB-PWY|) and a regulator |CITS: [15590624]|.
/
/In this pathway, putrescine is &gamma;-glutamylated at the expense of an ATP molecule. The resulting  &gamma;-glutamyl-putrescine is oxidized to &gamma;-glutamyl-&gamma;-aminobutyraldehyde, which is then dehydrogenated into 4-(glutamylamino) butanoate. In the last step, the &gamma;-glutamyl group is removed by hydrolysis, generating 4-aminobutyrate. 
/
/The key difference between this pathway and |FRAME:PUTDEG-PWY| is the &gamma;-glutamylation of putrescine. In the other pathway, putrescine is degraded directly to 4-amino-butanal |CITS: [15590624]|.
/
/Wild type <i>E. coli</i> cells are unable to utilize putrescine as the sole source of carbon at temperatures above 30&deg;C |CITS: [22636776]|.  It is possible to select for mutants that possess this ability; these mutants contain elevated levels of the enzymes in this pathway |CITS: [3510672]|.

COMMENT - Proline can serve as a total source of carbon and energy or of nitrogen for <i>E. coli</i>.  In the two steps
/(both of which are catalyzed by the product of <i>putA</i>) shown here, proline is converted to
/L-glutamate, which is further degraded to &alpha;-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle. 
/Curiously, L-glutamate, the obligate intermediate of the proline degradation pathway, cannot itself serve as
/a total source of carbon and energy for <i>E. coli</i>, because glutamate transport supplies exogenous
/glutamate at an inadequate rate. 
/
/Sometimes the proline degradation pathway is shown in three steps, with glutamate-5-semialdehyde as an
/intermediate between pyrroline-5-carboxylate and glutamate.  The conversion of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to
/glutamate-5-semialdehyde is thought to occur spontaneously, although the <i>putA</i> product might
/stimulate the reaction. 
/
/In addition to its being a building block of proteins, proline acts as an osmotic protectant.  Consistent with
/this latter role, high osmolarity inhibits proline degradation.

TYPES - Palmitoleate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - palmitoleate biosynthesis I (from (5Z)-dodec-5-enoate)
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Palmitoleate is a common unsaturated fatty acid, found in bacteria, fungi |CITS: [8294460]|, plants |CITS: [7548115]| and animals |CITS: [14321753][6030882]|. 
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, two unsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleate and <i>cis</i>-vaccenate, together comprise about one-half of the total fatty acid content of the organism. Palmitate, palmitoleate and <i>cis</i>-vaccenate make up the bulk of the fatty acids found in <i>E. coli</i> membranes |CITS: [8246839]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS): |FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, the extension of a cis-&delta;-5-decenoyl-[acp] to a palmitoleoyl-[acp] is believed to be catalyzed primarily by KASI. Inactivation of this enzyme leads to a lack of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [4901354]|. On the other hand, overexpression of KASI leads to the overproduction of <i>cis</i>-vaccenate |CITS: [6337151]|.
/
/It has been shown that the basal ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in <i>E. coli</i> is controlled by the level of two enzymes - |FRAME: FABA-CPLX| (|FRAME: EG10273|) and KASI |CITS: [8246839]|. The former introduces unsaturation (see |FRAME: PWY0-862|), while the other elongates the unsaturated fatty acid to the level of a palmitoleoyl-[acp] (this pathway).
/
/Additional control over this ratio is provided by temperature. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is known to increase in <i>E. coli</i> with lower growth temperature, a phenomenon found in most organisms that provides a mechanism for adjusting the lipid phase transition of the membrane phospholipids to differing temperatures. It has been shown that KASII which is responsible for the further elongation of the unsaturated fatty acids to the final level of <i>cis</i>-vaccenate (see |FRAME: PWY-5973|), is more active at low temperatures (relative to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis) than at high temperatures |CITS: [7002930]|. This relative increase results in the production of <i>cis</i>-vaccenate  rather than palmitoleate. Because the former (but not the later) can be incorporated into both positions of |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|, the synthesis of di-unsaturated phospholipids occurs and the thermotrophic phase transition of the membrane phospholipids is lowered |CITS: [6988423]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes. Palmitate is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in microorganisms, plants and animals. It was discovered by Edmond Fremy in 1840 in saponified palm oil, of which it is a major component, and hence its name.
/
/Palmitate is synthesized by stepwise condensation of C2 units to a growing acyl chain. Each elongation cycle results in the addition of two carbons to the acyl chain, and consists of four separate reactions. The first step is the condensation of a C2 unit with the nascent [acyl carrier protein]-bound acyl (acyl-[acp]) forming a |FRAME: B-KETOACYL-ACP| and CO<sub>2</sub>. This step is followed by reduction to |FRAME: OH-ACYL-ACP|, dehydration to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-ACP|, and a final reduction to form the elongated fatty acyl-[acp]. This chain of event repeats itself several times, until the final product, |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs|, is formed.
/
/There are two basic types of fatty acid biosynthesis systems, named type I and type II. The type I system is found in animals and lower eukaryotes (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5994|). The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid, while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex.
/
/The type II systems are found in bacteria and plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the Apicomplexa phylum |CITS: [17112527]|, and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.
/
/Unlike the type I system that accepts |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| as the source of the two-carbon units, the type II systems accept only |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|. In <i>E. coli</i> the final product of this pathway is |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs|. In some bacteria and plants, but not <i>E. coli</i>, the acyl moiety is released from the [acyl carrier protein] by an acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.14 or EC 3.1.2.21) |CITS: [22112270][1989513]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b> 
/
/This pathway is an instance of the generalized fatty acid elongation pathway depicted in |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|. It shows the elongation of |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs| produced by the fatty acid biosynthesis initiation reactions (shown in |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) to produce |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs|.
/
/As noted above, the final product of the <i>E. coli</i> pathway is |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs|. <i>E. coli</i> lacks an acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.14) that releases |FRAME: PALMITATE| from |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs|. Instead, the acyl chain of |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs| is transferred into membrane phospholipids by a <i>sn</i>-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase system (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1319|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/There are several alternative pathways for the degradation of trehalose.  Depending on the organism and the particular environmental conditions, trehalose may be broken down outside of the cytoplasm, enter the cell either through a permease, in which case it remains unmodified, or it may be transported by a phosphotransferase system (PTS), resulting in the phosphorylated trehalose-6-phosphate form.  Degradation can proceed by different mechanisms:  Unmodified trehalose may be degraded by a hydrolyzing trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182| and |FRAME: PWY0-1466|), or it may be split by the action of a trehalose phosphorylase (see |FRAME: PWY-2722| and |FRAME: PWY-2723|).  Likewise, trehalose-6-phosphate may be either hydrolyzed by trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase (see |FRAME: TREDEGLOW-PWY|) or it could be attacked by a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase (see |FRAME: PWY-2721|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Trehalase enzymes of the GH37 family of glycoside hydrolases hydrolyze a molecule of |FRAME: TREHALOSE| into two molecules of glucose with inversion of the anomeric configuration. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> can grow with trehalose as the sole carbon source, and employs different pathways for its degradation under different osmolarity conditions.  Under conditions of high osmolarity, the PTS pathway for uptake of trehalose (|FRAME: TREDEGLOW-PWY|) is blocked.  The |FRAME: TREHALAPERI-MONOMER| (TreA) provides the cell the ability to utilize trehalose under those conditions |CITS: [2671658]|.  External trehalose is hydrolyzed by TreA into two molecules of glucose |CITS: [2820965]|, which are then transported into the cytoplasm through the glucose PTS |CITS: [1825082]|.  TreA also has a second function: under high osmotic conditions, the bacterium synthesizes large amounts of trehalose to be used as an osmoprotectant.  TreA recycles trehalose molecules that leak from the cytoplasm into the periplasm |CITS: [3131312]|.
/
/Another pathway that utilizes a cytoplasmic trehalase is active during the transition period between high and low osmolarity (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182|).

COMMENT - While <i>E. coli</i> only synthesizes trehalose under conditions of high osmolarity, it can degrade the sugar under conditions of both low and high osmolarity and can utilize it as the sole carbon source.  Different pathways are employed under different osmolarity conditions.
/
/Under high osmotic conditions the bacterium synthesizes large amounts of trehalose, which is used as an osmoprotectant |CITS: [3131312]|.  Trehalose molecules that leak from the cytoplasm into the periplasm can be

/
/A second trehalase, TreF, is located in the cytoplasm and is active during the transition period between high and low osmolarity.  As the cells are shifting their metabolism to adjust to low osmolarity, TreF removes the internal pool of trehalose.  The relatively low enzymatic activity of TreF is low enough not to compromise the biosynthesis of trehalose during high osmolarity, yet is sufficient to degrade the accumulated trehalose after the return to normal conditions, when no more biosynthesis occurs |CITS: [8892826]|.

COMMENT - While <i>E. coli</i> only synthesizes trehalose under conditions of high osmolarity, it can degrade the sugar under conditions of both low and high osmolarity and can utilize it as the sole carbon source.  Different pathways are employed under different osmolarity conditions.
/
/The cell only synthesizes trehalose under high-osmolarity conditions.  Therefore, the only source of trehalose under low-osmolarity conditions is external.  Utilization of trehalose is induced by the presence of trehalose in the medium.  Trehalose is imported into the cell by the |FRAME: CPLX-168|, which is composed of the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> of the glucose PTS and a trehalose-specific |FRAME: TREB-MONOMER "EII<sup>Tre</sup>"|.  Trehalose is phosphorylated during transport and enters the cytoplasm as  trehalose-6-phosphate.
/
/The resulting trehalose-6-phosphate is then hydrolyzed by |FRAME: TRE6PHYDRO-MONOMER|, yielding glucose and glucose-6-phosphate.  The free glucose is phosphorylated further by glucokinase into a second molecule of glucose-6-phosphate, and both glucose-6-phosphate moieties enter glycolysis |CITS: [6370169][7608078][8083158]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes. In <i>E. coli</i> and most other Gram-negative facultative anaerobes it is one of three major isoprenoid quinones along with demethylmenaquinone and menaquinone (see pathways |FRAME: PWY-5852| and |FRAME: MENAQUINONESYN-PWY|). Each quinone is required for respiration using different, but overlapping subsets of final electron acceptors. In <i>E. coli</i> the quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are originally derived from the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (as indicated in the pathway links).
/
/The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain varies in different species. The number is determined by the specific polyprenyl diphosphate synthase (see |FRAME: CPLX0-7426|). For example, <i>E. coli</i> K-12 ubiquinone contains eight isoprenoid units, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> six, rat and mouse nine, and humans ten. The ubiquinones are often named according to either the number of carbons in the side chain (e.g. ubi-30) or the number of isoprenoid subunits (e.g. Q-10).
/
/Following addition of the polyprenyl tail, the 4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate product is processed by decarboxylation, oxidation, and methylation. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways differ in the order of these steps. In prokaryotes the compound is first decarboxylated, followed by oxidation and methylation. In eukaryotes the compound is oxidized and methylated prior to decarboxylation |CITS: [Shepherd96]|.
/
/The ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated primarily by the use of mutant strains that accumulate pathway intermediates. However some of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically characterized.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The best studied ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway is that of <i>E. coli</i> K-12, which produces ubiquinone-8. The first committed step of the pathway is the conversion of chorismate to 4-hydroxybenzoate by |FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5755|). The enzyme retains and is efficiently inhibited by the product of the reaction, 4-hydroxybenzoate, which may be a control mechanism for the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway or a mechanism for delivery of 4-hydroxybenzoate to the membrane |CITS: [11455603][11825618]|.
/
/The second step in the pathway is the transfer of the polyisoprenoid tail onto 4-hydroxybenzoate by the membrane-bound |FRAME: 4OHBENZOATE-OCTAPRENYLTRANSFER-MONOMER| as shown in this pathway. This is followed by decarboxylation of the ring structure by |FRAME: CPLX0-301|, utilizing a cofactor provided by |FRAME: UBIX-MONOMER "UbiX"|, to form 2-octaprenylphenol (|CITS: [25647642][26083743][26083754]| and commented in |CITS: [26083748]|).  Under anaerobic conditions, this compound accumulates in the membrane and is not converted into ubiquinone. Further steps in the pathway require the presence of dioxygen |CITS: [361395]|.
/
/Subsequent steps also involve the alternating introduction of three hydroxyl and three methyl groups. With the exception of the UbiG methyltransferase that catalyzes both of the <i>O</i>-methyltransferase reactions, few of the enzymes have been studied biochemically and their substrate and cofactor requirements are still unknown. The enzymes of this pathway may form a membrane-associated multienzyme complex |CITS: [393264]|. UbiX shows a genetic interaction with UbiG, suggesting a possible physical interaction within a complex |CITS: [16923914]|.
/
/The product of this pathway is shown as ubiquinol, the fully reduced form of ubiquinone. It is present in the cytoplasmic membrane (see the electron transfer pathways listed under |FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION|).
/
/Radiotracer studies in <i>E. coli</i>, yeast and mammalian cells have suggested that resveratrol and <i>p</i>-coumarate can serve as ring precursors for coenzyme Q biosynthesis |CITS: [25681964]|.

COMMON-NAME - L-leucine biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 1646790:EV-EXP-IMP:3380400286:shearer
COMMENT - Leucine biosynthesis involves a five-step conversion process
/starting with the valine precursor 2-keto-isovalerate. The final
/step in this pathway is catalyzed by two transaminases of broad
/specificity, IlvE and TyrB.
/
/Both the first enzyme in the pathway,
/2-isopropylmalate synthase, and the terminal transaminase TyrB
/are suppressed by leucine. TyrB is subject to inhibition
/by the pathway's starting compound, 2-keto-isovalerate, and by one
/of its off-pathway products, tyrosine. One consequence of this
/inhibition by 2-keto-isovalerate is that in the absence of IlvE activity,
/mutations in earlier
/steps in the pathway cannot be compensated for by any alternate
/method of introducing 2-ketoisocaproate for conversion to leucine.
/
/Almost all of the genes coding for enzymes in this pathway are
/controlled by attenuation. Attenuation in operon |FRAME: TU00179|
/is effected by a leader region containing four leucines and
/a transcriptional terminator |CITS: [6171647][6195343]|. <i>ilvE</i>
/is a component of operon |FRAME: TU524|, that has an attenuation
/region containing codons for isoleucine, leucine, and valine, as
/well as a termination site |CITS: [6154938][2007556]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Microorganisms and mammals share two of the major, initial routes for threonine degradation.  In the first route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (EC 4.3.1.19) to ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate.  A biosynthetic version of this enzyme also occurs (see |FRAME:THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|.  In the second route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREODEHYD-CPLX| (EC 1.1.1.103) to form 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, which is mainly cleaved by |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|, forming glycine and acetyl-CoA.  The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate can also be spontaneously converted to aminoacetone, which may be further metabolized to methylglyoxal (see |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  A third route has been demonstrated in several bacteria and fungi.  This route is based on the enzyme |FRAME:LTAA-CPLX| (EC 4.1.2.5), which cleaves threonine directly into glycine and acetaldehyde.
/
/<i>Escherichia coli</i> has been shown to assimilate nitrogen from some (but not all) amino acids, as well as agmatine, &gamma;-aminobutyrate and the polyamines putrescine and spermidine.  These nitrogen sources are used to generate glutamate and glutamine, the major intracellular nitrogen donors.  Some nitrogen sources, such as aspartate, can generate glutamate by transamination (see |FRAME: ASPAMINOTRANS-DIMER|).  Others, such as proline and arginine, produce glutamate as end products (glutamate generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| and |FRAME: AST-PWY|).  Other nitrogen sources, such as serine, require ammonia production for glutamate synthesis (ammonia generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: SERDEG-PWY|).  Ammonia generation is required for glutamine synthesis (see |FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|).
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> a low intracellular level of ammonia results in low intracellular glutamine and induction of the nitrogen-regulated (Ntr) response that involves response regulators |FRAME: GLNG-CPLX| and |FRAME: GLNL-CPLX|.  The Ntr response functions in ammonia assimilation, nitrogen scavenging and metabolic coordination.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has three systems that can transport threonine:  |FRAME: YGJU-MONOMER| |CITS: [12097162]|, |FRAME: ABC-15-CPLX| |CITS: [4583203]|, and |FRAME: TDCC-MONOMER| |CITS: [2115866]|.  Although <i>E. coli</i> can use threonine, glycine, or serine as a nitrogen source, efficient serine or threonine utilization requires amino acid supplementation.  Leucine supplementation is required for the use of threonine as a nitrogen source in pathways utilizing |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH) which is induced by leucine |CITS: [334738]| (see |FRAME: THREONINE-DEG2-PWY| and |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  TDH is is a major route for threonine degradation in <i>E. coli</i>.  A minor pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5436| and an anaerobic pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5437|.

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH) catalyzes the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent oxidation of threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate which is typically converted by |FRAME:AKBLIG-CPLX| into glycine and acetyl-CoA (see |FRAME:THREONINE-DEG2-PWY|).  However, it has been shown that 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate can also be non-enzymatically decarboxylated to aminoacetone.  In <i>E. coli</i>, a mutant that overproduced TDH utilized threonine as the sole carbon source and excreted glycine and aminoacetone into the medium.  Crude extracts of this mutant catalyzed a quantitative conversion of threonine to glycine and aminoacetone |CITS: [6413491]|.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> the subsequent metabolism of aminoacetone remains unclear.  In eukaryotic cells aminoacetone is oxidized to toxic methylglyoxal by semicarbazide-sensitive, Cu<sup>2+</sup>-dependent amine oxidases in a reaction yielding methylglyoxal, hydrogen peroxide and ammonia |CITS: [6833209][8920635][11559049]|.  However, <i>E. coli</i> contains a periplasmic |FRAME: AMINEOXID-CPLX| encoded by <i>tynA</i> that could hypothetically convert aminoacetone to methylglyoxal as predicted in this pathway.  Another possible route for aminoacetone metabolism was suggested by |CITS: [3920199]| who characterized an <i>E. coli</i> enzyme that stereospecifically and reversibly catalyzed the reduction of aminoacetone to D-1-amino-2-propanol (see |FRAME: GLYCDEH-CPLX|).  Methylglyoxal is toxic to <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [15489434]|, although it can be degraded as shown in the pathway link.
/
/Older literature reporting on the metabolism of aminoacetone in other microorganisms may also be relevant to <i>E. coli</i>.  Aminoacetone was first isolated and identified in the supernatant from washed cell suspensions of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> incubated with threonine |CITS: [13820014]|.  Subsequent reports were summarized by |CITS: [4292865]| who concluded that a number of microorganisms can metabolize aminoacetone via methylglyoxal.  In a species of <i>Arthrobacter</i>, aminoacetone in the growth medium was shown to be oxidatively deaminated to methylglyoxal by a putative amine oxidase |CITS: [5721463]|.  The conversion of aminoacetone to methylglyoxal has also been suggested to occur in <i>Serratia marcescens</i> although it was not experimentally demonstrated |CITS: [355220]|.   In cell-free extracts of a strain of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> grown on nutrient broth, aminoacetone was formed from threonine and was alternatively transaminated to methylglyoxal or reduced to 1-aminopropan-2-ol |CITS: [4986871]|.  In threonine-grown <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, data suggested that aminoacetone was reduced to 1-aminopropan-2-ol by a distinct aminoacetone NADH reductase |CITS: [4292837][4334917]|.  A <i>Pseudomonas</i> species utilized aminoacetone in a pathway involving its metabolism to L-1-aminopropan-2-ol by L-1-aminopropan-2-ol-NAD(P) oxidoreductase, with subsequent reactions converting the latter compound to propionate |CITS: [4362743]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Enteric bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. <i>enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium have been shown to possess two types of threonine dehydratases - a catabolic enzyme, which is induced by threonine (see |FRAME: THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX|), and a constitutively-produced biosynthetic enzyme (see |FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|.  Both enzymes convert threonine to 2-oxobutanoate.   While the biosynthetic enzyme is involved in isoleucine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ILEUSYN-PWY|), the catabolic enzyme participates in the degradation of threonine to propionate in a pathway that generates ATP and enables the utilization of threonine as a sole source of carbon and energy |CITS: [4370904]|. This <i>E. coli</i> anaerobic threonine dehydratase pathway is shown here |CITS: [9871012][9484901]|.
/
/The first reaction in this pathway is catalyzed by catabolic threonine dehydratase which degrades threonine to 2-oxobutanoate (&alpha;-ketobutyrate) and ammonia.  The 2-oxobutanoate then undergoes lyase cleavage with the addition of coenzyme A to form propanoyl-CoA and formate.  Two such lyases were discovered in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 |CITS: [9484901]|.  Both of these enzymes, |FRAME:PYRUVFORMLY-CPLX| encoded by gene <i>pflB</i> and |FRAME: KETOBUTFORMLY-MONOMER| encoded by gene <i>tdcE</i>, are expressed only under anaerobic conditions, and both utilize a glycyl radical as part of their catalytic mechanism |CITS:[9767563]|.  TdcE is equally active with 2-oxobutanoate and pyruvate substrates, whereas PflB prefers pyruvate.  Once propanoyl-CoA is formed, it is processed via propionyl-phosphate to propionate in a reaction sequence that produces ATP.  Acetate kinase AckA can also utilize propionate as a substrate in the final reaction.  The enzymes in this pathway are also able to process L-serine, with pyruvate as the final product |CITS: [9871012]|.
/
/Features of this energy-generating pathway include substrate-level phosphorylation, a requirement for cAMP-CRP, and catabolite repression.  The <i>tdc</i>ABCDEFG operon genes also encode |FRAME: TDCC-MONOMER| (see above), |FRAME: CPLX0-7622|, and |FRAME: G7626-MONOMER|.  Regulators of the operon include adjacent |FRAME: PD03292|, |FRAME: PC00004|, |FRAME: PC00027|, and |FRAME: PD00268|.

/Microorganisms and mammals share two of the major, initial routes for threonine degradation.  In the first route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (EC 4.3.1.19) to ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate.  A biosynthetic version of this enzyme also occurs (see |FRAME:THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|.  In the second route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREODEHYD-CPLX| (EC 1.1.1.103) to form 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, which is mainly cleaved by |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|, forming glycine and acetyl-CoA. The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate can also be spontaneously converted to aminoacetone, which may be further metabolized to methylglyoxal (see |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  A third route has been demonstrated in several bacteria and fungi.  This route is based on the enzyme |FRAME:LTAA-CPLX| (EC 4.1.2.5), which cleaves threonine directly into glycine and acetaldehyde.
/
/<i>Escherichia. coli</i> has been shown to assimilate nitrogen from some (but not all) amino acids, as well as agmatine, &gamma;-aminobutyrate and the polyamines putrescine and spermidine.  These nitrogen sources are used to generate glutamate and glutamine, the major intracellular nitrogen donors.  Some nitrogen sources, such as aspartate, can generate glutamate by transamination (see |FRAME: ASPAMINOTRANS-DIMER|).  Others, such as proline and arginine, produce glutamate as end products (glutamate generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| and |FRAME: AST-PWY|).  Other nitrogen sources, such as serine, require ammonia production for glutamate synthesis (ammonia generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: SERDEG-PWY|).  Ammonia generation is required for glutamine synthesis (see |FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|).
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> a low intracellular level of ammonia results in low intracellular glutamine and induction of the nitrogen-regulated (Ntr) response that involves response regulators |FRAME: GLNG-CPLX| and |FRAME: GLNL-CPLX|.  The Ntr response functions in ammonia assimilation, nitrogen scavenging and metabolic coordination.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has three systems that can transport threonine:  |FRAME: YGJU-MONOMER| |CITS: [12097162]|, |FRAME: ABC-15-CPLX| |CITS: [4583203]|, and |FRAME: TDCC-MONOMER| |CITS: [2115866]|.  Although <i>E. coli</i> can use threonine, glycine, or serine as a nitrogen source, efficient serine or threonine utilization requires amino acid supplementation.  Leucine supplementation is required for the use of threonine as a nitrogen source in pathways utilizing |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH) which is induced by leucine |CITS: [334738]| (see |FRAME: THREONINE-DEG2-PWY| and |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As noted above, this pathway is considered to be the major route for threonine degradation in <i>E. coli</i>.  The first reaction in this pathway involves the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent oxidation of threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate (2-amino-3-ketobutyrate) catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH). The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate is then converted to glycine by the enzyme |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|.  Glycine serves as the actual nitrogen donor in this pathway by its conversion to serine and the deamination of serine (see below). TDH is formed aerobically in cells grown in synthetic medium with glucose, and its activity is increased with L-leucine supplementation |CITS: [334738]|.  In contrast, the enzyme |FRAME: THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (TdcB, threonine deaminase (biodegradative)) which forms 2-oxobutanoate and ammonia under anaerobic conditions is involved in pathway |FRAME: PWY-5437|.
/
/The product of the TDH reaction, 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate (2-amino-3-ketobutyrate) can also be nonenzymatically decarboxylated to aminoacetone as shown in pathway |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|.  
/
/The pathway shown here allows threonine utilization as a nitrogen source and as a carbon source and it also functions as a glycine source (see Reitzer review below).  It has also been characterized as an alternate pathway for serine biosynthesis in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [3108237]|.  Glycine produced in this pathway can be catabolized by the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY| as shown in the pathway link.  In addition, studies of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 using glycine as a sole nitrogen source suggested that glycine is converted to serine by the reversible |FRAME: GLYOHMETRANS-MONOMER|-catalyzed reaction (as shown in the reaction link) followed by serine deamination to produce pyruvate and ammonia |CITS: [764875][334738]| (see pathway |FRAME: SERDEG-PWY|).  Thus, during threonine catabolism, ammonia from serine acts as the nitrogen donor |CITS: [334738]|.  Although this pathway has been shown to be reversible <i>in vitro</i>, its <i>in vivo</i> role is in threonine catabolism |CITS: [8407827]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Many organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, possess an L-threonine aldolase that can catalyze the interconversion of threonine and glycine |CITS: [5353532][5438301][9151955][9228760][9346293][9464392][9692922][17172352]|.  Two types of the enzyme have been described, a low-specificity L-threonine aldolase which accepts both L-threonine and L-<i>allo</i>-threonine |CITS:[9151955]| (see <i>Escherichia coli</i> |FRAME: LTAA-CPLX|), and an L-<i>allo</i>-threonine aldolase characterized in <i>Aeromonas jandaei</i> |CITS: [9228760]| (see |FRAME:CPLX-7268|).
/
/Despite the wide distribution of L-threonine aldolase, its physiological significance is uncertain.  It is important for the synthesis of cellular glycine in yeast |CITS: [9163906]|, but not in wild-type <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [9692922]|.  In <i>E. coli</i>, if the major glycine biosynthetic pathway is disrupted by a <i>glyA</i> mutation, |FRAME: LTAA-CPLX| may provide an alternative glycine biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [9692922]| (see |FRAME: GLYSYN-PWY|).  Although purified GlyA was also shown to cleave threonine, it did so at a very slow rate |CITS: [3891721]| (see |FRAME: GLYOHMETRANS-CPLX|).  Overall, the low-specificity L-threonine aldolase pathway is considered to be a minor pathway of threonine degradation in <i>E. coli</i>.

COMMENT - Different strains of <i>E. coli</i> have the ability to utilize certain aromatic acids as the sole source of carbon.  Shown here, <i>E. coli</i> K-12 can grow on both |FRAME: 3-PHENYLPROPIONATE| and |FRAME: 3-HYDROXYPHENYL-PROPIONATE| |CITS: [6345502]|.  
/
/This is one of only two aromatic-ring-cleavage pathways found in <i>E. coli</i> (for the second one, see |FRAME: PWY0-321|). That <i>E. coli</i> can degrade aromatic acids suggests a wider natural distribution for <i>E. coli</i>E. coli than the anaerobic environment of the animal gut |CITS: [6345502]|. In the utilization of aromatic acids as a carbon and energy source, <i>E. coli</i> employs a branched meta-cleavage pathway for the degradation of 3-phenylpropionate and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate.  Degradation of these two compounds ultimately yields succinate, acetaldehyde and pyruvate.  Acetaldehyde is further metabolized to yield acetyl-CoA. The pathway has eight known steps, which makes it among the longest catabolic sequences in <i>E. coli</i>.  |CITS: [3531186][8399388][9098055]|

COMMENT - Under conditions of anaerobiosis and phosphate starvation (believed to reflect conditions in the gut),
/<I>E. coli</I> converts glucose to weak organic acids which, though they are excreted, can reenter
/the cell and cause bactericidal acid stress even at only moderately acidic pH.  Acid resistance
/system 4 (AR4) is the lysine-dependent acid resistance system which allows for the survival of
/<I>E. coli</I> under these conditions when lysine is available.  AR4 couples the transport activity
/of a lysine:cadaverine antiporter, CadB, with lysine decarboxylase, CadA.  CadB functions by
/exchanging external lysine for internal cadaverine.  Lysine is imported into the cell through CadB. 
/Within the cell lysine is decarboxylated by CadA to cadaverine, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> and
/replacing it with a proton.  Cadaverine is then exported through CadB.  This effectively consumes
/protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH.  The glutamate-dependent acid resistance system
/(AR2) is also able to provide acid resistance to <I>E. coli</I> growing under conditions of anaerobiosis
/and phosphate starvation, but to a slightly lesser degree than AR4 possibly due to the different pH
/optimums of their respective decarboxylase enzymes. |CITS:[17209032]|

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Polyamines (the most common of which are putrescine, spermidine and spermine) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|.  Putrescine and spermidine are found in all domains of life and are the major polyamines in bacteria.  Spermine is found mostly in eukaryotes.  While polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> remain poorly understood |CITS:[3157043]|.  Polyamines have been proposed to stimulate cell growth in <i>Escherichia coli</i> through stimulation of protein synthesis (reviewed in |CITS: [16428314]|.  In <i>E. coli</i> deletion of all genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis resulted in a 40-50% reduced growth rate in amine-free medium under aerobic conditions, although polyamines were required for growth of this strain under strictly anaerobic conditions |CITS: [19542271]|.  
/
/Putrescine can be formed either directly from L-ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (this pathway) or indirectly from L-arginine by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (see pathway |FRAME:PWY-40| which is also found in <i>E. coli</i>, and |FRAME:PWY-43| found in other bacteria and plants).  Both the ODC and ADC pathways have been demonstrated in mammals |CITS:[11804860] [14738999]| and higher plants |CITS: [11537482]|.  In bacteria the ODC and ADC pathways are common and are often found in the same organism (|CITS:[3157043]| and reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).
/
/Enteric bacteria possess two forms of ornithine decarboxylase, a biosynthetic (constitutive) form shown in this pathway which is  apparently present in all strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and a biodegradative (inducible) form (see |FRAME:ORNDECARBOXDEG-CPLX|) which is present in some strains of <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [3157043] [1939141]|.  Other bacteria such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> appear to have only a single ornithine decarboxylase which is regulated in a complex manner to ensure proper expression for both polyamine biosynthesis and degradation.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/L-ornithine can be decarboxylated to putrescine for two purposes, either anabolically for the generation of putrescine itself and putrescine as a precursor of spermidine (this pathway), or catabolically as a carbon and nitrogen source.  In the anabolic ODC pathway shown here putrescine is generated from L-ornithine in a single reaction by the biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase encoded by gene <i>speC</i>.  Experiments have demonstrated that <i>E. coli</i> K-12 cells can take up radiolabeled ornithine and convert to putrescine via this pathway |CITS: [5330264]|.  In the catabolic ODC pathway shown in |FRAME:ORNDEG-PWY| putrescine is generated in the first reaction by the degradative ornithine decarboxylase encoded by gene <i>speF</i>.
/
/Biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase is inhibited by both putrescine and spermidine, and is activated by GTP and other nucleotides |CITS: [4370496]|.  The synthetic compound difluoromethylornithine is an irreversible inhibitor of most ornithine decarboxylases |CITS:[6421528]| although the <i>E. coli</i> enzyme is not inhibited by this compound |CITS:[6800359]|.  As indicated in the pathway link, spermidine is biosynthesized from putrescine and decarboxylated <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine in a reaction catalyzed by the product of gene <i>speE</i> (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).

COMMENT - |FRAME: 7-Deazapurines "7-Deazapurines"| are compounds that contain pyrrolopyrimidine functional groups (similar to purines, but lackinging one of the nitrogens in the pentameric ring).  These compounds form a structurally diverse class of nucleoside analogues that often possess antibiotic, antineoplastic, or antiviral activities.
/
/An important |FRAME: 7-Deazapurines "7-deazapurine"| compound is |FRAME: CPD-13053|, a modified nucleoside that is present in certain tRNAs in bacteria and most eukaryotes (with the exception of mycoplasmas and yeast), but not in the archaea |CITS: [12697167]|.  The pathway describing the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-13053| can be found at |FRAME: PWY-6700|.
/
/The biosynthesis of all 7-deazapurines proceeds via the common intermediate |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, which is produced in four steps from the nucleotide |FRAME:GTP|.  The pathway starts with the conversion of GTP to |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3| by |FRAME: FOLE-CPLX|, an enzyme that is also involved in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: THF|.  |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3| is converted to |FRAME: CPD0-1699| by the action of |FRAME: G7431-MONOMER|.  
/
/This intermediate is converted to |FRAME: CPD-13043| by an unusual transformation catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU13740-MONOMER| (|FRAME: BSU13740|), a member of the radical SAM enzyme superfamily.  The corresponding <i>E. coli</i> enzyme has not yet been identified, but an ortholog, |FRAME: G7443|, exists.
/
/Finally, the carboxylate moiety of |FRAME: CPD-13043| is converted to a nitrile in an ATP-dependent reaction in which ammonia serves as the nitrogen source.  The reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: G6245-MONOMER|, generating the final product, |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE| |CITS: [19354300]|.

COMMON-NAME - polymyxin resistance
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3427830418:keseler
COMMENT - |FRAME: Polymyxins Polymyxins| are antibiotics with a general structure consisting of a cyclic peptide with a long hydrophobic tail. 
/They are produced by the Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME:TAX-1406| and are selectively toxic for Gram-negative bacteria due to their specificity for the lipopolysaccharide molecules that exist within many Gram-negative outer membranes. Polymyxins disrupt the structure of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with its phospholipids, and specifically with lipid A. Lipid A is negatively charged due to two phosphate groups, and the cationic polymyxin readily binds to it and induces cell death by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane.
/
/Some Gram-negative bacteria, specifically Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, can become resistant to polymyxin by the modification of  their lipid A structure via the  attachment of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinopyranose (L-Ara4N) groups to one or more phosphate groups |CITS: [17686460][18467098][19076233][19767429][ 21114395]|. This addition causes an absolute increase in lipid A charge, thus lowering the affinity of positively charged polymyxins |CITS: [18187325]|.
/
/The modification of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinopyranose (L-Ara4N) was first found in mutants of <i>E. coli</i> that are resistant to polymyxin |CITS: [7565089][11535605]|. However, the pathway for the synthesis of L-Ara4N and its transport and attachment to lipid A has been studied mostly in Salmonella.
/
/The pathway is well understood up to the formation of |FRAME: CPD0-888| (UDP-Ara4FN). All steps up to this intermediate occur in the cytoplasm. UDP-Ara4FN is deformylated and transferred from the inner to the outer bacterial membrane by mechanisms that are not fully understood, although ArnE(PmrM) and ArnF(PmrL) may have a role in the transportation of UDP-Ara4FN across the bacterial inner membrane |CITS: [17928292]|. Once in the periplasm, LAra4N is transferred to lipid A by ArnT(PmrK) |CITS: [15939024][12045108][16226890]| .
/
/The pathway is regulated by the |FRAME: PWY0-1482| (pmrA/pmrB). |FRAME: EG11615| is a response regulator that in its phosphorylated form can activate the genes that encode the proteins described in this pathway. Activation occurs either directly by Fe3+ ions |CITS: [11051552]|, or by a second two component system, the |FRAME: PWY0-1458|, which is activated by low Mg2+ concentration |CITS: [9371451]|. 
/The two systems are linked in Salmonella by the polymyxin resistance protein, |FRAME: G7172-MONOMER PmrD|. The PhoP-activated PmrD protects the phosphorylated response regulator PmrA from dephosphorylation, and promotes the transcription of PmrA-activated genes responsible for polymyxin resistance |CITS: [10775270]|. However, in E. coli PmrD does not protect the phosphorylated |FRAME: EG11615|. This may be the reason why E. coli fails to activate the pathway under low Mg2+ concentrations |CITS: [10373459]|.

COMMON-NAME - guanine and guanosine salvage
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Guanosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i> as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6125|. In that route GMP is synthesized via IMP and XMP, which is converted to GMP by the action of GMP synthetase, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate. Note that the free base guanine or the ribonucleoside guanosine are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle guanosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathway is responsible for degradation of the nucleotides to the nucleoside guanosine and the base guanine, which can be further degraded via xanthine and urate (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6608|).  In some organisms urate is catabolized to basic building blocks (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5691|). However, both guanosine and guanine can be salvaged by certain enzymes and converted back to their nucleotide form as shown in this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6618|.  In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the pathway shown here is the major salvage route.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> phosphorolytic cleavage of the <i>N</i>-glycosyl bond of of purine ribonucleosides or deoxyribonucleosides, as shown here for guanosine, is catalyzed by the purine nucleoside phosphorylases encoded by genes <i>deoD</i> and <i>xapA</i>. The released purine base, in this case guanine, is subsequently converted to a nucleotide, in this case GMP, by the action of phosphoribosyltransferases encoded by genes <i>gpt</i> and <i>hpt</i>.
/
/DeoD is the classical purine nucleoside phosphorylase I. It utilizes guanosine, adenosine, or inosine (or their corresponding deoxyribonucleosides) as substrate. Synthesis of this enzyme is induced in the presence of deoxyribonucleosides, inosine, or guanosine in the growth medium.  As shown here it cleaves guanosine to guanine and &alpha;-D-ribose-1-phosphate. XapA (xanthosine phosphorylase) cleaves 6-oxopurine ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides and is induced after exposure of cells to xanthosine in the medium |CITS: [7007809]|.
/
/In the second step, the two phosphoribosyltransferases Hpt and Gpt salvage 6-oxopurine bases.  Gpt and Hpt utilize 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate to convert the free base guanine to the mononucleotide GMP. As shown in <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, together these enzymes can rescue all 6-oxopurine bases |CITS: [4563984]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-322| encoded by <i>E. coli</i> gene <i>gsk</i> can phosphorylate guanosine directly to GMP, which can enter the |FRAME: PWY-6125| pathway as indicated by the pathway link. Even though genes encoding this enzyme have been identified only in bacteria and archaea |CITS: [10879466]|, this activity has also been reported for some plants |CITS: [Combes89]|. Either this pathway, or pathway |FRAME: PWY-6620|, enables <i>E. coli</i> to salvage the degradation products of guanosine nucleotides and recycle them back to nucleotide form.
/
/Studies using purified <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: CPLX0-322| showed that guanosine is the physiological substrate although the enzyme can also utilize inosine.  End product inhibition by GMP was demonstrated.  The data suggested that guanosine kinase may be a regulatory enzyme that has a role in modulating nucleotide levels |CITS: [10879466]|.

COMMENT - Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) are the fundamental units in isoprenoid biosynthesis.  <i>E. coli</i> derives its IPP and DMAPP from D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate via this pathway.
/
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield 1-deoxy-D-xylylose 5-phosphate (DXP).  DXP is then rearranged and reduced to generate the pathway's namesake compound, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP).  In the third reaction MEP is converted into 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol, which is subsequently phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methylerythritol 2-phosphate.  This product is then converted into 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate.  This compound is then reduced to generate 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate.  In the final step, this diphosphate compound is converted by a single enzyme into a 5-6:1 ratio of IPP and DMAPP.  This ratio is subsequently adjusted to 3:7 by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.  Both IPP and DMAPP then become the basic building blocks of polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize propionate as the sole source of carbon and energy, utilizing the methylcitrate cycle |CITS: [9325432][10348870][12473114]|.  
/
/Propionate can have broad negative effects on the bacterial cell functions, including cytosol acidification, dissipation of the proton motive force, disruption of CoA homeostasis, and, in some cases, inhibition of the key TCA enzymes aconitase and citrate synthase due to formation of |FRAME: CPD-622|.  For these reasons, propionate is sometimes used as a preservative in foods.  However, some bacteria are able to degrade propionate, and even use it as the sole carbon source.  Of all the propionate degradation pathways, the 2-methylcitric acid cycle is the most widely destributed.  In this pathway, the C&alpha; methylene group of propionate is oxidized to a keto group yielding |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, a common precursor for biosynthesis and energy production.  The pathway, which was discovered in fungi |CITS: [Tabuchi74]|, was best characterized in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [10482501][11294638]|.
/
/The initial step of the pathway is the activation of |FRAME: PROPIONATE| to |FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA| by one of two possible propionyl-CoA synthetases: the dedicated |FRAME: G6200-MONOMER|, or |FRAME: ACS-MONOMER| utilizing propionate as an alternative substrate.  This is followed by the synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-622| from |FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA| and |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX0-251|.  (However, |FRAME: CITRATE-SI-SYNTHASE| may also play a role in this pathway; a <i>gltA</i> mutant has a lower growth rate on propionate than wild type |CITS: [9579066]|.)  |FRAME: CPD-622| is then dehydrated to |FRAME: CPD-1136| by |FRAME: G6199-MONOMER|, followed by rehydration to |FRAME: CPD-618| (catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX0-7761 "AcnB"|) and cleavage of the latter into |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: SUC|, performed by |FRAME: CPLX0-1021|. 
/
/Even though the pathway is depicted as linear here, it is considered a cycle since oxaloacetate can be regenerated from succinate via enzymes of the |FRAME: TCA| |CITS: [10482501]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Polyamines (the most common of which are putrescine, spermidine and spermine) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|.  Putrescine and spermidine are found in all domains of life and are the major polyamines in bacteria.  Spermine is found mostly in eukaryotes.  While polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> remain poorly understood |CITS:[3157043]|.  Polyamines have been proposed to stimulate cell growth in <i>Escherichia coli</i> through stimulation of protein synthesis (reviewed in |CITS: [16428314]|.  In <i>E. coli</i> deletion of all genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis resulted in a 40-50% reduced growth rate in amine-free medium under aerobic conditions, although polyamines were required for growth of this strain under strictly anaerobic conditions |CITS: [19542271]|.  Studies of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> polyamine-deficient strain showed that spermidine, as well as putrescine, plays a role as an extracellular signaling molecule in the induction of swarming and that induction is dependent on the |FRAME: ABC-24-CPLX| (PotABCD) |CITS: [20051267]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Spermidine is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to putrescine, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed spermidine synthase, the the product of gene <i>speE</i> (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|). The source of the propylamine group is decarboxylated <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine (<i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methioninamine) which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is <i>S</i>-methyl-5'-thioadenosine (MTA), which can be recycled back to L-methionine in many organisms, but not in <i>E. coli</i> (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1391|).
/
/Inhibition of <i>E. coli</i> adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by spermidine appears to be the most significant regulator of polyamine biosynthesis, probably limiting it when the intracellular spermidine concentration becomes excessive.  In <i>E. coli</i> most intracellular spermidine is bound to nucleic acids and phospholipids.  Reviewed in |CITS: [3157043]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The only unsaturated fatty acids found in <i>E. coli</i>, |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247|, comprise about one-half the fatty acid content of the organism |CITS: [4562402]|. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is known to increase in <i>E. coli</i> with lower growth temperature. This phenomenon, found in most organisms, that provides a mechanism for adjusting the lipid phase transition of the membrane phospholipids to differing temperatures.
/
/|FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| encoded by |FRAME: EG12606| is the only enzyme that can catalyze the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-9245| to |FRAME: CPD-9247|, and is believed to play a major role in the thermal regulation of fatty acid composition of the membrane phospholipids of <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [6988423]|. |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| is one of three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS) in <i>E. coli</i>: |FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.
/
/It has been shown that |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| is more active at low temperatures (relative to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis) than at high temperatures |CITS: [7002930]|. This relative increase results in the production of |FRAME: CPD-9247| rather than |FRAME: CPD-9245|. Furthermore, because the former (but not the later) can be incorporated into both positions of |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|, the synthesis of diunsaturated phospholipids occurs and the thermotrophic phase transition of the membrane phospholipids is lowered |CITS: [6988423]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first step in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-9247| from |FRAME: CPD-9245| is elongation from C<sub>16</sub> to C<sub>18</sub> with formation of a 3-oxo group, catalyzed by the product of |FRAME: EG12606|. The next three steps then complete the elongation cycle. These include reduction of the 3-oxo group, dehydration to form the <i>trans</i>-2-enoyl-ACP |FRAME: cis-vaccen-2-enoyl-ACPs|, and reduction of the resulting 2,3 double bond to form the acyl-ACP, |FRAME: Cis-vaccenoyl-ACPs|.
/
/The dehydration step is catalyzed by FabZ. A second dehydratase encoded by |FRAME: EG10273| prefers substrates with 10-carbon aliphatic chains and does not use unsaturated substrates |CITS: [8567624][8805534]|. FabA functions at the branch point between saturated and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-862|).
/
/The identity of the reductase that catalyzes the fourth reaction is likely to be FabI. It has been suggested that FabI is probably the only such reductase that participates in both saturated and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [7592873]|. The acyl-ACP (|FRAME: Cis-vaccenoyl-ACPs|) formed is utilized for phospholipid biosynthesis (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1319|). In the final reaction, although the function of the TesA thioesterase is unclear, it can potentially liberate the free fatty acid |FRAME: CPD-9247|.

COMMENT - The pathway of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids branches from the pathway leading to saturated
/fatty acids at |FRAME: Beta-hydroxydecanoyl-ACPs|. Two dehydratases, FabA and FabZ, function
/for the most part interchangeably in converting |FRAME: OH-ACYL-ACP| of various chain lengths,
/saturated or unsaturated, to the corresponding |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-ACP| unsaturated forms.
/But FabA has the unique ability of converting some of the |FRAME: Trans-D2-decenoyl-ACPs|
/produced to |FRAME: Cis-delta-3-decenoyl-ACPs|.
/The <i>trans</i> form is subsequently reduced and stays in the pathway leading to saturated fatty acids.
/However, the <i>cis</i>-form cannot be reduced. Instead it serves directly as a substrate for the
/condensing enzyme, FabB, and the subsequent three reactions shown here that lengthen the chain
/by two carbon atoms. As might be predicted, mutant strains unable to produce active FabA are unable
/to make unsaturated fatty acids, but make a normal complement of saturated fatty acids.
/
/Repeated cycling of these four elongation reactions eventually lead to the unsaturated fatty acids,
/|FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247|, that are incorporated into various lipids.
/<i>E.coli</i> produces greater amounts of |FRAME: CPD-9247| when grown at lower temperature.
/This modulation is effected by one condensing enzyme, FabF, that initiates elongation of
/|FRAME: CPD-9245| to form |FRAME: CPD-9247|; it is activated at low temperature.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleotides are components of nucleic acids in all living organisms.  Although the enzymatic steps in their <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis are conserved, some differences in the enzymes exist.  For example in bacteria and plants the three steps leading from carbamoyl phosphate to orotate are catalyzed by three different proteins, while in mammals they are catalyzed by a single multifunctional CAD protein.  In plants and animals the last two steps of the pathway are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme UMP synthase, whereas bacteria express two separate proteins for this purpose (in |CITS: [8619816][12369616]| and reviewed in |CITS: [16669783]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts bicarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP), a pyrimidine ribonucleotide that can be subsequently converted to other pyrimidine ribonucleotides as shown in the link at the end of this pathway, and in the superpathway links below.
/
/The first enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, forms carbamoyl phosphate from ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia derived from L-glutamine.  Carbamoyl phosphate is both an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis and also a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids such as L-arginine and L-citrulline as shown in the pathway link, and L-canavanine in plants |CITS: [16480916]|.
/
/The next step, which is catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamylase, is the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate with L-aspartate forming <i>N</i>-carbamoyl-L-aspartate.  This is the committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis.  <i>N</i>-carbamoyl-L-aspartate, is then cyclized to (<i>S</i>)-dihydroorotate, the first intermediate that contains a pyrimidine ring.  This compound is oxidized to orotate by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.  Orotate, an aromatic pyrimidine base, is therefore formed in three steps from carbamoyl phosphate. 
/
/The final two steps, the condensation of orotate with PRPP forming the first pyrimidine nucleotide orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP), followed by the decarboylation of OMP to UMP, are carried out by the enzymes orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase.  UMP was identified in early work as an inhibitor of the first enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase |CITS: [4358555]|.
/
/In enteric bacteria the pyrimidine biosynthetic genes are scattered on the chromosome and may be a single transcriptional unit or part of a small operon.  They have their own regulatory mechanisms and are not regulated by a common repressor.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts bicarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to the pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP), as shown in the pathway link to |FRAME: PWY-5686| at the beginning of this pathway.  UMP can subsequently be converted to other pyrimidine ribonucleotides as shown in this pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Uridine-5'-phosphate (UMP) is converted to UDP and then to UTP by two kinase reactions.  The first is a specific kinase encoded by <i>pyrH</i> and the second is a nonspecific kinase encoded by <i>ndk</i>.  CTP is synthesized from UTP in an amination reaction involving CTP synthetase, a glutamine amidotransferase encoded by <i>pyrG</i>.
/
/Uridylate kinase (UMP kinase) controls the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of other pyrimidine nucleotides.  The <i>E. coli</i> enzyme is highly regulated by UTP inhibition and GTP activation.  Feedback inhibition by UTP is important for an optimal response to nutritional conditions such as growth on orotate |CITS: [23903661]|.  Bacterial UMP kinases are potential targets for drug development due their differing specificity and structure from animal CMP/UMP kinases |CITS: [19071117]|.  CTP synthetase is also highly regulated and is of interest as a drug target |CITS: [18003612]|.

TYPES - TRYPTOPHAN-BIOSYNTHESIS
COMMON-NAME - L-tryptophan biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> tryptophan is biosynthesized from chorismate, the principal common precursor of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine, as well as the essential compounds tetrahydrofolate, ubiquinone-8, menaquinone-8 and enterobactin (enterochelin), as shown in the |FRAME: ALL-CHORISMATE-PWY|.  Five genes encode five enzymes that catalyze tryptophan biosynthesis from chorismate.  The five genes <i>trpE trpD trpC trpB trpA</i> form a single transcription unit, the <i>trp</i> operon.  A weak internal promoter also exists within the <i>trpD</i> structural gene that provides low, constitutive levels of mRNA, although its exact physiological function is unclear |CITS: [6305961]|.
/
/Two of the genes in the <i>trp</i> operon encode bifunctional enzymes, each containing two independent catalytic domains.  Thus, a total of seven catalytic domains are involved in tryptophan biosynthesis.  The two bifunctional enzymes encoded by <i>trp D</i> and <i>trpC</i> appear to have arisen from ancestral gene fusion events with <i>trpG</i> and <i>trpF</i>, respectively.  Gene <i>trpG</i> which encodes a glutamine amidotransferase subunit of anthranilate synthase and gene <i>trpF</i> which encodes a phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase exist separately in some organisms.  Two hetromultimeric, &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> protein complexes participate in the pathway, anthranilate synthase formed from the products of genes <i>trpD</i> and <i>trpE</i> and tryptophan synthase formed from the products of genes <i>trpA</i> and <i>trpB</i>.  Reviewed in |CITS: [15262409] [12966138]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The two last steps in this pathway are catalyzed by a single enzyme, tryptophan synthase, which is composed of two &alpha; and two &beta; subunits (E.C. reaction 4.2.1.20).  However, it has been shown that each of the subunits is responsible for catalyzing an individual step, and is able to catalyze that step on its own.  Thus, the activity of tryptophan synthase was divided into two individual steps in the pathway, each catalyzed by the corresponding subunit.  Indole is not a free intermediate, it is transferred between subunits within the enzyme complex |CITS: [1899028]|.  As shown in the transport links in this pathway, evidence suggests that exogenous serine |CITS: [9852024]| and indole |CITS: [1917834]| may also contribute to tryptophan biosynthesis.
/
/The rate-limiting step in this pathway has not been fully defined.  A spontaneous enol/keto tautomerization of 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino-1'-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate has been postulated as rate-limiting in the pathway, but it remains to be proven |CITS: [7727401]|.  In addition, chorismate synthase (see |FRAME: ARO-PWY|) has been proposed as a rate limiting enzyme in the common aromatic pathway (see the superpathway links below) based upon its apparently constitutive synthesis and its relatively low specific activity in cell extracts (see EcoSal reference below).
/
/The biosynthesis of tryptophan is an energetically costly process due to its requirement for D-erythrose-4-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and ATP for chorismate biosynthesis, as well as glutamine, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and serine for the conversion of chorismate to tryptophan.  The pathway is therefore highly regulated at multiple levels and its regulation has been studied in great detail.  Transcriptional regulation by repression is mediated by tryptophan binding to the <i>trp</i> repressor, a product of the unlinked <i>trpR</i> gene.  Regulation also occurs by a complex transcriptional attenuation mechanism involving synthesis of the tryptophan-containing leader peptide encoded by gene <i>trpL</i>, mediated by the availability of tryptophan-charged tRNA<sup>trp</sup> (see EcoCyc transcription unit page |FRAME: TU00067| for a detailed summary of <i>trp</i> operon transcriptional regulation mechanisms).  Post-translational regulation occurs by allosteric feedback inhibiton of anthranilate synthase by tryptophan.  Reviewed in |CITS: [15262409] [12966138] [17601995]|.
/
/The homologous tryptophan operon of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (<i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>) has also been well studied and the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway shown here also applies to this organism.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> the isoprenoid diphosphate (2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is a precursor of the three major isoprenoid quinones ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone. These quinones function as electron carriers within the cytoplasmic membrane. Each is required for respiration using different, but overlapping subsets of final electron acceptors (see pathways |FRAME: PWY-6708| |FRAME: PWY-5852| and |FRAME: MENAQUINONESYN-PWY|). Their isoprenoid side chain is biosynthesized as shown in this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY-5783|. In addition, FPP is also a precursor of <i>di-trans,octa-cis</i>-undecaprenyl diphosphate, an isoprenoid diphosphate that participates in pathways |FRAME: ECASYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|.

/In the first reaction |FRAME: IPPISOM-MONOMER| catalyzes the reversible isomerization of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), a key step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. In <i>E. coli</i> these two compounds are bisoynthesized by the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY|. In the second and third reactions, two head-to-tail condensation reactions catalyzed by the product of gene |FRAME: EG10508| ultimately produce FPP. First, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) is formed from the condensation of DMAPP and IPP, then another IPP molecule is added to GPP to form FPP. The isoprenyl chain is further elongated as shown in the linked pathways.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone (Q) as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone (MK) and/or demethylmenaquinone (DMK) as the main quinone.  However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain MK or DMK as their main quinones.  Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, contain Q, MK, and DMK, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|.
/
/DMKs are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism.  The most common DMKs contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units.  <i>E. coli</i> contains demethylmenaquinone-8 (DMK-8) |CITS: [6406647]|.  DMK-8 is a low-molecular weight lipophilic component of the cytoplasmic membrane and functions as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.  
/
/DMK is also an intermediate in MK formation (see |FRAME: PWY-5838|) |CITS: [11153266]|.  DMK-8 is methylated at the naphthoquinone ring to MK-8 by a methyltransferase, which uses S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The conversion of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA) to DMK-8 in extracts of <i>E. coli</i> is catalyzed by the membrane-bound 1,4-dihydroxy-2-octaprenyltransferase (MenA).  The conversion of DHNA to DMK requires replacement of the carboxyl with the isoprenoid side chain.  Prenylation and decarboxylation may occur in a single active site, since symmetry experiments exclude 1,4-naphthoquinone as an intermediate.  Moreover, there has been no evidence for two separate reaction steps or enzymes.  Based on structural and mutagenesis data, a three-stage ionization-condensation-elimination mechanism involving a carbocation intermediate has recently been proposed |CITS: [25051182]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The pyridine nucleotide coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD, formerly named DPN) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP, formerly named TPN) play key roles as cofactors in oxidation-reduction reactions in all living cells.  The nicotinamide ring functions as a prosthetic group for these reactions.  Their oxidized forms are depicted here as  NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> due to the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring.  Their reduced forms are referred to as NADH and NADPH.  Although they appear chemically equivalent, their metabolic roles differ.   NAD<sup>+</sup> is generally the cofactor for energy-producing oxidation reactions, while NADPH is the cofactor for reductive biosynthetic reactions.  The pentose phosphate pathway, the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme (Icd) and the PntAB transhydrogenase (see below) are important sources of NADPH (in |CITS: [14660605]|).
/
/Despite their importance, the regulation of NAD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation remains incompletely defined.  Earlier work on the kinetics of pyridine nucleotide metabolism in <i>Escherichia coli</i> demonstrated that the ratio of NADP to NAD results largely from the rates of NADP and NAD interconversion (in |CITS: [4146187]|).
/
/The reversible reduction of both NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> is carried out by the two transhydrogenase isoforms shown in the reaction links.  The PntAB product of genes <i>pntA</i> and <i>pntB</i> is located in the inner membrane and also functions as a proton pump.  Its physiological function is to catalyze energy-dependent reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> with NADH.  The soluble product of gene <i>sthA</i> is thought to function mainly in the reoxidation of NADPH with NAD<sup>+</sup>.  The expression of these two isoforms is modulated by the redox state of cellular metabolism |CITS: [14660605]|.  In |CITS: [5543676]| and reviewed by Penfound, T. and J.W. Foster in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see below).

/<b>About This Pathway</b>

/NAD kinases have been characterized in organisms from a variety of taxonomic groups including archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes (reviewed in |CITS: [18391451]|).  The NAD kinase of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> has been shown to be essential for growth |CITS: [16682646]| and evidence for its essentiality in <i>E. coli</i> has been presented |CITS: [12142426]|.
/
/In contrast, NADP phosphatases (NADPases) remain poorly characterized despite their important role.  Although an NAD kinase homolog in the archaeon <i>Methanococcus jannaschii</i> was shown to also have NADP phosphatase activity, NADP phosphatases from eubacterial and eukaryotic sources still require identification of the genes encoding them and further study of their enzymatic properties.  In <i>E. coli</i> the product of <i>cysQ</i> showed high NADP and NADPH phosphatase activities, but kinetic studies of the purified enzyme suggested that it is not the true NADP phosphatase of this organism.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Phenylpropanoid compounds are abundant in natural environments where they can originate from putrefaction of proteins in soil or as breakdown products of plant materials such as lignin, various oils, and resins. Microbial catabolism of phenylpropanoids plays an important role in the natural degradation of these compounds (in |CITS: [9603882]|). 
/
/The degradation of the phenylpropanoids <i>trans</i>-cinnamate, 3-phenylpropionate (3-phenylpropanoate) and their hydroxylated derivatives has been reported in several members of the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria |CITS: [5881653][3777934][4348920][9324265]| including <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 and other strains of <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [6345502]|. In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 this pathway is one of only two aromatic-ring-cleavage pathways that are found in the organism.  The other aromatic-ring-cleavage pathway is |FRAME: PWY0-321|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>mhp</i> and <i>hca</i> encoded enzymes of the pathway shown here can metabolize both <i>trans</i>-cinnamate and its hydroxylated derivatives, and 3-phenylpropionate and its hydroxylated derivatives (as shown in pathway |FRAME: HCAMHPDEG-PWY|).  In these pathways 2,3-dihydroxy-<i>trans</i>-cinnamate and  3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate undergo ring cleavage by the <i>meta</i>-cleaving dioxygenase MhpB |CITS: [9603882]|.
/
/This pathway ultimately yields fumarate and 2-oxopent-4-enoate, which is further degraded to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA as described in the linked pathway |FRAME: PWY-5162|. This pathway, including the portion that is described in |FRAME: PWY-5162|, has eight steps, making it one of the longest catabolic sequences known in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [3531186][8399388][9098055]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 can grow on 3-phenylpropionate, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, or 3-hydroxy-<i>trans</i>-cinnamate as sole source of carbon and energy. It cannot grow on <i>trans</i>-cinnamate for unknown reasons, although whole cells can readily oxidize this compound after growth with 3-phenylpropionate |CITS: [6345502][9603882]|.
/
/The fact that <i>E. coli</i> can degrade aromatic acids suggests a wider natural distribution for <i>E. coli</i> than the anaerobic environment of the animal gut |CITS: [6345502]|. As a facultative anaerobe, <i>E. coli</i> must be able to survive and grow in habitats such as soil, water and food, during interhost transfer.

TYPES - Tetrapyrrole-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - tetrapyrrole biosynthesis I (from glutamate)
CITATIONS - 2077690:EV-EXP-TAS:3357327664:caspi
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Tetrapyrroles are compounds whose molecules have four rings of the pyrrole type, generally linked together by single-atom bridges between the alpha positions of the five-membered pyrrole rings. Tetrapyrroles function as a metal-binding cofactor in many important enzymes, proteins and pigments, such as heme, chlorophyll, cobalamine (vitamin B12), siroheme, and cofator F430.
/
/The biosynthesis of all of these cofactors start in a similar manner, with the production of the intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III. This intermediate is an important branch point: its methylation directs it toward siroheme, cobalamin or cofactor F430 synthesis, while decarboxylation directs it toward the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll |CITS: [14633982]|. 
/
/The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway starting point can be either glycine or glutamate. The pathway shown here starts with glutamate. However, regardless of whether the starting point is glycine or glutamate, both pathways converge at the intermediate 5-amino-levulinate and proceed through the important intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III, which is a major branch point that leads to biosynthesis of different tetrapyrrole compounds, such as the corrinoid cobalamine (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), the methanogenic coenzyme F<sub>430</sub> (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|),  |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|, and heme D.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) can be considered to be the first universal, committed tetrapyrrole precursor. This pathway is called the five-carbon pathway because ALA is formed from the intact five-carbon skeleton of glutamate (glu). In <i>E. coli</i> the transformation of glu to ALA consists of three enzyme-catalyzed steps. In the first step, glu is activated by ligation to tRNA in a reaction identical to the tRNA-charging reaction in protein biosynthesis, catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GltX). Like aminoacyl-tRNA formation, this reaction requires ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Next, the glu is converted to a reduced form in a reaction that requires a reduced pyridine nucleotide, catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (HemA). The product of this reduction has been characterized as glu 1-semialdehyde (GSA). Finally, the positions of the nitrogen and oxo atoms of the reduced five-carbon intermediate are interchanged to form ALA, catalyzed by the enzyme GSA aminotransferase (HemL). 
/
/Porphobilinogen (PBG) synthase (HemB) catalyzes the asymmetric condensation of two ALA molecules to form PBG, with the release of two molecules of water. The amino group of this ALA molecule is a critical component of the binding site for the other ALA molecule. During the formation of PBG, removal of hydrogen to form the aromatic pyrrole ring must occur on the enzyme, as is indicated by the stereospecific retention the hydrogen atom that is derived from the pro-S C5 hydrogen of ALA. The reaction requires no external energy source. <i>E. coli</i> PBG synthase requires Zn<sup>2+</sup> for activity. 
/
/Uroporphyrinogen III, the last common precursor of all end product tetrapyrroles, is synthesized from PBG by the sequential action of two enzymes, hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) synthase (HemC) and uroporphyrinogen III synthase (HemD). HMB synthase condenses four PBG molecules to form the first tetrapyrrole, HMB. The released product, free HMB, rapidly cyclizes spontaneously and irreversibly to form the nonphysiological product uroporphyrinogen I. Biosynthesis of the biologically relevant isomer, uroporphyrinogen III, requires the presence of a second enzyme, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, during or immediately after release of HMB.
/
/An initially puzzling report showed that <i>E. coli</i> <i>hemB</i> mutant cells, which were unable to form active PBG synthase, were also deficient in HMB synthase activity unless PBG was supplied in the medium.  Finally, highly purified recombinant <i>E. coli</i> HMB synthase was discovered to contain a covalently bound dipyrromethane (dipyrrole) that is an essential cofactor for enzyme activity. The cofactor is synthesized from HMB and is ligated to a Cys residue (C242 of the <i>E. coli</i> enzyme). Once bound, the dipyrrole cofactor remains permanently attached to the enzyme, and its free &alpha;-position serves as a ligand for oligomerization of PBG substrate units to form the tetrapyrrole product. Scission of the link between the cofactor and the nascent oligopyrrole chain after the hexapyrrole stage is reached releases HMB and prepares the enzyme-bound dipyrrole cofactor to accept new substrate molecules. The existence of the dipyrrole cofactor explains the previously reported requirement for PBG to obtain active hydroxymethylbilane synthase in <i>hemB</i> mutant <i>E. coli</i> cells.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The transition element molybdenum (Mo) has been long known as an essential micronutrient across the kingdoms of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria.  However, molybdate itself is catalytically inactive and, with the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, needs to be activated through complexation by a special cofactor.  There are several molybdenum cofactors, including |FRAME: CPD-4| (MPT), |FRAME: CPD-582| (MGD), |FRAME: CPD0-1882|, or others |CITS: [1587808]|.
/
/The chemical nature and biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactors have been investigated in detail in bacteria |CITS: [7836363][8514783][8514782][1587808][14761975]| and plants |CITS: [16669776][16784786][12147719][16234918][9421926]|.  All of the different cofactors are synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-4| (MPT).  The variability of the molybdenum cofactors found in bacteria is achieved by the attachment of GMP, AMP, IMP, or CMP to the phosphate group of MPT.
/
/The MPT structure is conserved in all organisms and it has been demonstrated that its biosynthesis is preserved in bacteria and plants alike.  It is produced from |FRAME: GTP| via |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z| (precursor Z) in two steps.
/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The small subunit of MPT synthase (|FRAME: EG11597-MONOMER "MoaD"|) contains a double glycine motif at the C terminus.  The free carboxylate group of the terminal glycine is activated by the accessory protein |FRAME: EG10154-MONOMER "MoeB"| to a carboxy-adenylate form, which is then sulfurylated by the action of two sulfurtransferases, one of which is a rhodanese, resulting in a thiocarboxylate.  Each small subunit in the complex donates the sulfur atom of the thiocarboxylate to |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z|, resulting in formation of |FRAME: CPD-4| |CITS: [11459846]|.
/
/The insertion of Mo into molybdopterin, forming the biologically active prosthetic group, is catalyzed by the |FRAME: EG10153-MONOMER "MoeA"| protein, while the MogA protein enhances this process in an ATP-dependent manner |CITS: [17198377]|.

TYPES - Adenine-Adenosine-Salvage
COMMON-NAME - adenine and adenosine salvage II
CITATIONS - 11027694:EV-EXP-IDA:3532375396:fulcher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i>, or by recycling of the free base adenine and the ribonucleoside adenosine.  In the <i>de novo</i> route AMP is synthesized via IMP and adenylo-succinate, which is converted to AMP by the action of |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|).  Note that adenine and adenosine are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/However, the distinction between nucleoside degradation and recycling via salvage pathways is not always straightforward.  Salvage pathways start with the nucleoside or free base forms and lead to the formation of the nucleotide forms.  Degradation pathways usually start with the nucleotide form and end with compounds such as urate, that may lead to production of energy and provision of nitrogen and carbon.
/
/Many organisms including <i>E. coli</i> can recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways.  In <i>E. coli</i> the degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of nucleotides (AMP) to nucleosides (adenosine) (see pathway |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|) and free bases (adenine) (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6617|).  In the former pathway, adenosine is further degraded to urate.  Although radiolabelled carbon experiments have indicated the presence of a uricase that catalyzes the degradation of urate to <i>S</i>-allantoin, no such enzyme has been detected in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [10986234]|.  Three variants of salvage pathways for adenosine and adenine found in <i>E. coli</i> are shown in this pathway, pathway |FRAME: PWY-6609| and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6611|.
/
/Purine salvage pathways also ensure that <i>E. coli</i> mutants that are unable to synthesize the intermediate IMP by the <i>de novo</i> pathways can obtain any purine bases or purine nucleosides that are present in the growth medium.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway described here is found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  In it, the purine nucleoside (adenosine) is first hydrolyzed to D-ribose and the free base (adenine) by nucleoside hydrolase action.  The bases are then converted to the mononucleotide form (AMP) by |FRAME: ADENPRIBOSYLTRAN-CPLX|, which utilizes 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose-1-diphosphate.
/
/As indicated in the links at the beginning of the pathway, exogenous adenosine can be transported into the cell, or endogenous adenosine produced by AMP nucleosidase action may be utilized.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Cyanate can occur inside the cell as a result of nonenzymatic decomposition of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, and in
/the environment due to dissociation of urea and photooxidation of cyanide.  Although cyanate at high concentrations
/is toxic to <i>E. coli</i>, it can serve as a sole source of nitrogen due to the production of ammonia by cyanase
/|CITS: [3034861]|.  The cyanate degradation pathway therefore serves the dual purpose of detoxification and nitrogen
/utilization |CITS: [7768821]|.  
/
/Cyanase catalyzes the first step of the pathway, producing CO<sub>2</sub> and the unstable compound carbamate. 
/Carbamate spontaneously decomposes to CO<sub>2</sub> and ammonia, thus producing a source of nitrogen for
/growth.  The second enzyme of this pathway, carbonic anhydrase, is an essential component of the pathway.  In the
/absence of carbonic anhydrase at atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, non-enzymatic hydration of
/CO<sub>2</sub> is not sufficient to prevent depletion of the intracellular bicarbonate pool due to rapid diffusion of
/CO<sub>2</sub> |CITS: [8444806]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential and ubiquitous cofactor occurring in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. 
/It is utilized both as a source of the phosphopantetheine moiety of certain proteins and as a carrier in a
/large number of reactions central to intermediary metabolism.  CoA is the acyl carrier required for reactions
/in both biosynthetic and degradative pathways, forming derivatives that are key intermediates in energy
/metabolism.
/
/The biosynthesis of CoA was recognized as a target for antibacterial drug discovery.  Interest in the human
/pathway was sparked by the association of a neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in pantothenate
/kinase.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Pantothenate is the starting compound for the biosynthesis of CoA.  <i>E. coli</i> can synthesize
/pantothenate via the |FRAME: PANTO-PWY| pathway or import it from the medium via the
/|FRAME: PANF-MONOMER|.  Five enzymatic steps then convert pantothenate to CoA. 
/
/Pantothenate kinase first phosphorylates pantothenate to 4'-phosphopantothenate; the enzyme is feedback
/inhibited by CoA itself, accounting for the primary regulatory mechanism of CoA biosynthesis.  The
/addition of cysteine, resulting in the formation of (R)-4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC), and the
/subsequent decarboxylation of PPC to 4'-phosphopantetheine, are catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme. 
/The enzymatic activities can be separated, and indeed exist as two separately encoded enzymes in other
/organisms.  Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase finally convert
/4'-phosphopantetheine to CoA.
/
/All enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth of <i>E. coli</i>.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i>, or by recycling of the free base adenine and the ribonucleoside adenosine.  In the <i>de novo</i> route AMP is synthesized via IMP and adenylo-succinate, which is converted to AMP by the action of |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|).  Note that adenine and adenosine are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.

/This pathway shares some steps with pathway |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|.

The  phosphorylases <i>deoD</i> and <i>xapA</i> constitute the major route for salvage of the purine moieties of both ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides, which are subsequently converted to nucleotide form by phosphoribosyltransferase reactions.
/
/As indicated in the links, exogenous adenine can be transported into the cell by the product of <i>yieG</i> (<i>purP</i>) (see |FRAME: EG11724-MONOMER|), or it can enter via a low-affinity uptake process |CITS: [8165228]|.

COMMON-NAME - siroheme biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 7945210:EV-EXP-IGI:3662221140:fulcher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Siroheme is an iron-containing isobacteriochlorin, a modified tetrapyrrole similar in structure to both heme and chlorophyll that was discovered in 1973 |CITS: [4583265]|. Siroheme is structurally and biosynthetically related to the corrin ring of vitamin B12. Siroheme is covalently coupled to an iron-sulfur cluster ([FeS]) to form an electronically integrated metallo-cofactor for delivering electrons to substrate. Siroheme is found as a prosthetic group of several enzymes, including sulfite and nitrite reductases, which catalyze the six-electron reductions of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonium, respectively. 
/
/The two known siroheme-containing enzymes of <i>E. coli</i> are |FRAME: SULFITE-REDUCT-CPLX| which can also function as an assimilatory nitrite reductase, and dissimilatory |FRAME: NITRITREDUCT-CPLX| |CITS: [8994874]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, siroheme is derived from uroporphyrinogen III by (i) methylation of the tetrapyrrole ring at positions C-2 and C-7 to form precorrin-2 (dihydrosirohydrochlorin), (ii) oxidation of precorrin-2 to the tetrahydroporphyrin sirodihydrochlorin by removal of two electrons, and (iii) chelation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> |CITS: [8243665]|. 
/
/Methylation of rings A and B of uroporphyrinogen III to produce precorrin-2 effectively limits subsequent oxidation beyond the tetrahydroporphyrin (dihydrochlorin) state. Oxidation of precorrin-2 to sirodihydrochlorin produces a compound that has the aromaticity and metal-binding properties necessary for efficient chelation of Fe<sup>2+</sup>.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, <i>cysG</i> is the only gene that encodes uroporphyrinogen methyltransferase. The <i>E. coli</i> <i>cysG</i> product is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes all steps of the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to siroheme in the enteric bacteria, and the enzyme has been named siroheme synthase |CITS: [8243665]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of lipoate is unusual, and shares the same mechanism as the biosynthesis of biotin.  The first enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: EG11591-MONOMER|, transfers the octanoate moiety from octanoate-ACP molecules to specific lysyl residues in lipoate-dependent enzymes, resulting in octanylated domains, and regenerating the acyl-carrier protein in the process |CITS: [8002607][14700636]|.
/
/The next enzyme in the pathway, |FRAME: CPLX0-782|, catalyzes the conversion of the octanoyl side chain to an active lipoyl, generating a fully active lipoylated domain.  The enzyme is an iron-sulfur protein that requires the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) |CITS: [8444795][11106496]|.  An electron which originates from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the enzyme serves to split at least two molecules of AdoMet into a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and methionine |CITS: [11834738]|.  The radical then abstracts a hydrogen from a C-H bond of the octanoyl side chain, becoming 5'-adenosine in the process.  The newly-formed unstable octanoyl radical then reacts directly with the Fe-S center of the enzyme.  Two sulfur atoms from the center enter the structure of the octanoyl side chain, producing lipoyl, which dissociates from the enzyme along with excess iron, leaving it with a [2Fe-2S] center.  Thus, in this unusual reaction, the iron-sulfur center of the enzyme is not just a catalytic accelerator, but also a substrate, donating the two sulfur atoms |CITS: [11153271]|.  It should be noted that although this process has been well documented <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [11106496]|, there is still a possibility that there exists another sulfur donor <i>in vivo</i>, and that the Fe-S center acts as sulfur donor only in the absence of this natural donor |CITS: [11395404]|.
/
/It has been suggested that the conversion of octanoylated-domains to lipoylated ones described in this pathway may be a type of a repair pathway, activated only if the other lipoate biosynthetic pathways are malfunctioning |CITS: [14700636]|.
/
/Other routes for lipoate incorporation involve the lipoyl-protein ligase LplA, which utilizes either lipoate or octanoate imported from outside the cell (see |FRAME: PWY0-522| and |FRAME:PWY0-1275|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Isoprenoids are a large class of compounds that includes sterols, dolichols, triterpenes, ubiquinone, and the prenyl groups attached to some macromolecules.  They function in a variety of processes found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes including electron transport, hormone signaling, transcriptional and post-translational regulatory processes, meiosis, apoptosis, protein degradation and the biosynthesis of glycoproteins.  They are also structural components of the membranes of cells and organelles.  
/
/There are two major biosynthetic routes for the essential isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, the mevalonate pathway and the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| (non-mevalonate pathway).  The mevalonate pathway is found in most eukaryotes, archaea and a few eubacteria.  The non-mevalonate pathway is found in eubacteria, the chloroplasts of plants, cyanobacteria, algae and apicomplexan parasites.  <i>Escherichia coli</i> and other Gram-negative bacteria utilize the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| to synthesize isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate which are the precursors of 2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl diphosphate.  The latter compound is a precursor of di-<i>trans</i>,poly-<i>cis</i>-undecaprenyl phosphate, which leads to the biosynthesis of cell wall polymers (see below).

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12  (2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl diphosphate is formed by the joining of geranyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: FPPSYN-MONOMER| encoded by gene <i>ispA</i>, as shown in the pathway link.  In the pathway shown here, multiple units of isopentenyl diphosphate are polymerized to form di-<i>trans</i>,octa-<i>cis</i>-undecaprenyl diphosphate in a series of sequential condensation reactions catalyzed by undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase encoded by gene <i>ispU</i>.  
/
/Subsequent polymerizations are carried out by other enzymes, depending on the configuration of the isoprenoid compound being formed.  Additions to (2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl diphosphate in the <i>cis</i> configuration are catalyzed by |FRAME: UPPSYN-CPLX| as described in this pathway.  Additions in the <i>trans</i> configuration are catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX0-7426| encoded by gene <i>ispB</i> leading to the synthesis of ubiquinol-8 and menaquinol-8 (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5783|).
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12, di-<i>trans</i>,octa-<i>cis</i>-undecaprenyl diphosphate is dephosphorylated to form di-<i>trans</i>,octa-<i>cis</i>-undecaprenyl phosphate (as reviewed in the EcoSal citation below).  Multiple genes may encode the dephosphorylating enzymes |CITS: [15778224 ]| (see |FRAME: G6439-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG11665-MONOMER|, and |FRAME: PGPPHOSPHAB-MONOMER|).  Di-<i>trans</i>,octa-<i>cis</i>-undecaprenyl phosphate is the essential carrier lipid used in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and enterobacterial common antigen (as shown in the pathway links) as well as other cell wall polymers.  Inhibitors of |FRAME: UPPSYN-CPLX| (IspU) have been investigated as novel antimicrobial agents |CITS: [18295483]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In all kingdoms of life the sequential addition of isoprenoid units to (2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl diphosphate is performed by polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzymes. Additional isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by each specific enzyme. Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules such as quinones. The enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a preference for a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.
/
/In most organisms there is one predominant type of quinone with a specific polyprenyl chain length. However, they also have minor amounts of quinones with a different polyprenyl chain length. Quinones containing chains of eight prenyl units are found in all kingdoms of life. They are particularly common among the Archaea and the Enterobacteriaceae.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols play major roles in the cell in maintaining redox balance, a reduced environment, and defense against reactive oxygen species. In most organisms the major thiol is the tripeptide glutathione (>-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine, GSH).  Most of the glutathione pool is kept in its reduced form. In <i>E. coli</i>, the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione is approximately 200:1 |CITS: [11544348]|. The functionality of glutathione largely depends on its being in a reduced form.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> two pathways utilize NADPH to reduce disulfide bonds, the thioredoxin system (see |FRAME: THIOREDOX-PWY|) and the glutaredoxin system (described here). Glutaredoxins are ubiquitous oxidoreductase enzymes that perform some essential cytoplasmic redox reactions using glutathione as an electron donor. For example they can serve as a hydrogen donor for the glutathione-dependent reduction of enzymes such as |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX|, |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| and |FRAME: EG12237-MONOMER|. Four glutaredoxins have been identified in <i>E. coli</i>, Grx1, Grx2, Grx3 and Grx4 which have both overlapping and distinct activities |CITS: [10593884][11544348][13678528][15833738][20604742]| (see |FRAME: GLUTAREDOXIN-MONOMER|, |FRAME: RED-GLUTAREDOXIN|, |FRAME: OX-GLUTAREDOXIN-B|, |FRAME: GRXB-MONOMER|, |FRAME: OX-GLUTAREDOXIN-C|, |FRAME: GRXC-MONOMER|, and |FRAME: EG12181-MONOMER|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/After reducing protein disulfide groups back to their native form, the resulting oxidized glutaredoxins (shown here as a class |FRAME: Ox-Glutaredoxins|) are reduced back to their active form (|FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|) with electrons donated by reduced glutathione molecules. In this reaction two molecules of the reduced form of glutathione are oxidized, condensing them into the single molecule glutathione disulfide. This may be a nonenzymatic process. No experimental evidence for an <i>E. coli</i> enzyme that specifically catalyzes the reduction of Grx1, Grx2 or Grx3 was found in a literature search, although a protein disulfide oxidoreductase could hypothetically catalyze this reaction. The glutathione disulfide is then reduced back into two individual glutathione molecules by the action of the NADPH utilizing enzyme |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX| encoded by gene <i>gor</i>.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The thiol redox system of <i>Escherichia coli</i> consists of the thioredoxin pathway (shown here) and the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway (see |FRAME: GLUT-REDOX-PWY|).  Electrons from NADPH flow through these pathways via gradients in redox potentials.  Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin reduce disulfide bonds by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism involving two active site cysteine residues in the motif CXXC (where X is any amino acid) that form either a disulfide or a dithiol.  In addition to the importance of thiol redox potential |CITS: [10464247]|, other important factors in the thiol redox system are cellular location |CITS: [9724776]| and the overall redox state of the cell.  Both the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways appear to operate in parallel.  Genetic studies in <i>E. coli</i> have shown the two pathways to be functionally redundant during aerobic growth, although inactivation of both pathways results in unviability.  Reviewed in |CITS: [17659286] [18423382] [11544348]|.  
/
/The thioredoxin pathway is involved in reducing important cytoplasmic enzymes such as the essential ribonucleotide reductase, as well as 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase and methionine sulfoxide reductases A and B.  <i>E. coli</i> thioredoxin also binds to bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and serves as its processivity factor for polymerization during phage growth  (|CITS: [20080681]| and in |CITS: [9440688]|).  In addition, many other proteins that may interact with thioredoxin have been identified |CITS: [15502869] [15004283]|.  Thioredoxin is also involved in a pathway for the trans-membrane transfer of reducing potential from the cytoplasm to the periplasm to reduce the protein disulfide isomerase DbsC |CITS: [9352906] [19258316]|.  After acting as a reductant, disulfide-containing oxidized thioredoxin is reduced back to a dithiol by thioredoxin reductase, an FAD-containing, NADPH-dependent enzyme.   Reviewed in |CITS: [17659286]|.  
/
/The thiol redox system is present in taxonomic groups from archaea to man.  However, despite structural and mechanistic similariteis between prokaryotic and eukaryotic thiol redox systems, their overall cellular functions differ (reviewed in |CITS: [17659286]| and |CITS: [11012661]|).

As shown in the gene-reaction schematic on this page, these proteins are the products of genes <i>trxC</i> and  <i>trxA</i>, respectively.  Clicking on either of the instance names (or on their gene or protein symbols in the gene-reaction schematic) will display a page showing some structural and functional properties of the respective protein.

/Again in the pathway diagram, clicking on the protein class named "an oxidized thioredoxin" will display a page showing two instances of this class named oxidized thioredoxin and oxidized thioredoxin 2.  Note that in the gene-reaction schematic shown on this page the reduced thioredoxins are considered to be the direct gene products and their oxidized forms are shown separately as modified forms of the gene products.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> TrxA is a more well studied thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase than TrxC (Trx2).  TrxC was identified later as a novel thioredoxin that forms a subfamily of the TrxA protein family.  The gene encoding TrxC is under control of the transcriptional regulator OxyR which responds to oxidative stress, although the biological role of TrxC remains to be fully elucidated |CITS: [9388228] [12952960]|.

COMMENT - Polyamines (such as spermidine) and thiols (such as glutathione) are found in millimolar concentrations in most living organisms.  Polyamines have a variety of roles, including charge neutralization and complexation of the anionic phosphodiester backbone of DNA.  Thiols also have many roles, including detoxification of xenobiotics and reactive oxygen species, maintaining the redox balance in the cell, and serving as cofactors for many enzymatic reactions.
/
/Several organisms are able to conjugate the two together by forming an amide link between spermidine and glutathione, resulting in either of the two forms <i>N</i><sup>1</sup>-glutathionylspermidine, or <i>N</i><sup>8</sup>-glutathionylspermidine.
/
/This compound was first discovered in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS: [Dubin59]|, but was not characterized in regard to its physiological role.  Later it was shown that the compound is present in the pathogenetic protozoa <i>Trypanosoma</i> and <i>Leishmania</i> |CITS: [3883489]|.  In these parasites, a second glutathione molecule is added to glutathionylspermidine, forming trypanothione, which in these organisms provides the functional roles of glutathione (see |FRAME: TRYPANOSYN-PWY|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols are compounds that play a major role in the detoxification of stress-inducing factors.  The tripeptide glutathione (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly, GSH) is generally the major component of the non-protein thiol fraction in the cell.  Pathogenic bacteria live in a particularly hostile environment, in which the host deliberately generates toxins, including reactive oxygen species, to destroy the invading organism.  Thus thiols are particularly important for the survival of these organisms.  GSH is a component of the thiol redox system, which controls the redox state of cytoplasmic cysteine residues.  In <i>E. coli</i>, a specific target is ribonucleotide reductase.
/
/While GSH is the major thiol in eukaryotes, Gram-negative bacteria and the majority of Gram-positive bacteria, it is not universal.  In some organisms other thiols have taken its role, including |FRAME: CoM|, |FRAME: TRYPANOTHIONE|, ergothioneine, |FRAME: CPD1G-2| and the ovothiols.

/
/The starting compound for pantothenate biosynthesis, |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, is derived from the

/|FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE|, is subsequently reduced by

COMMENT - tRNAs are the molecular adapters that allow the synthesis of proteins based on mRNAs transcribed from protein-coding genes. The active form of tRNA is generated by a combination of nuclease-based processing, the modification of select nucleosides, and finally charging via the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|.
/
/tRNA processing is a multi-step pathway carried out by a mix of endonucleases and exonucleases. Processing begins with the endonucleolytic cleavage of individual tRNA precursors from RNAs containing multiple tRNAs. This initial cleavage can generate precursor molecules with a long 5' trailing end or with a short 5' extension. Precursors with a long trailer require additional exonucleolytic processing before the other nucleases in the pathway can act.
/
/Following this initial processing step, a suite of ribonucleases cut down the 5' and 3' ends to yield the final, processed tRNA.
/
/Although this processing pathway can function with as a few as one of its constituent exonucleases, the final tRNA product may be "imperfect," with a 3' end that may be longer or shorter than normal.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) or vitamin B<sub>6</sub>. PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors that participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. This vitamin has a role in numerous human body functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to its recent discovery as a potent antioxidant. Its <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis occurs only in bacteria, fungi and plants, making it an essential nutrient in the human diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of this vitamin was thoroughly studied in <i>E. coli</i> and involves two branches with seven enzymatic steps. In one branch, the sequential action of the enzymes Epd, PdxB and SerC results in the convesrion of erythrose 4-phosphate into 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine. The latter then undergoes oxidation and decarboxylation by PdxA to form 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate. In the other branch, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) is derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate by the action of Dxs. The products of the two branches, i.e. 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate and DXP, are then condensed by PdxJ to form PNP, which enters the salvage pathway to undergo oxidation by PdxH to form the PLP cofactor.
/
/From the six pdx genes, two of them, <i>epd</i> and <i>serC</i>, are involved in other metabolic processes, but <i>pdxA</i>, <i>pdxB</i>, <i>pdxJ</i> and <i>pdxH</i> are unique for PLP biosynthesis |CITS: [1537800]|. PdxJ, the PNP synthase is the key ezyme that catalyzes a multistep ring closure yielding PNP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This is the last step in the <i>de novo</i> synthetic pathway.
/
/An alternative and recently discovered DXP-independent pathway for PNP biosynthesis begins with glutamine in other micro-organisms and is very similar both structurally and mechanistically to the one in <i>E. coli</i>. 
/
/This topic has been reviewed in |CITS: [17822383][15242009][12686115]|.

COMMON-NAME - queuosine biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3512752052:keseler
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-13053 "Queuosine"| is an important |FRAME: 7-Deazapurines 7-deazapurine"|-modified nucleoside that is present in certain tRNAs in bacteria and most eukaryotes (with the exception of mycoplasmas and yeast).  It is not found in the archaea |CITS: [12697167]|.  Prokaryotes can synthesize queuosine <i>de novo</i> by a complex biosynthetic pathway, whereas eukaryotes are unable to synthesize it, and utilize a salvage system, acquiring the |FRAME: QUEUINE| base as a nutrient factor from their diet or from intestinal microflora |CITS: [19925456 ]|.
/
/Queuosine and its derivatives occur exclusively at position 34 (the wobble position) in the anticodons of tRNAs coding for the amino acids |FRAME: HIS|, |FRAME:L-ASPARTATE|, |FRAME: ASN| and |FRAME: TYR| |CITS: [ 4550561]|.  Each of these tRNAs posses the anticodon sequence GUN (positions 34-36), where N can be any nucleotide.  Queuosine improves accuracy of translation |CITS: [2988936][11532950]|.  These tRNAs of the 'Q-family' originally contain guanine in the first position of anticodon, which is post-transcriptionally modified with |FRAME: QUEUINE| by an irreversible insertion during maturation. 
/
/Beside the 7-deazaguanosine core, queuosine possesses an additional adaptation - a cyclopentenediol ring attached to an aminomethyl group at position 7.  The cyclopentendiol ring can be further modified by glutamylation (see |FRAME: EG11362-MONOMER|) |CITS: [16164993]|.
/
/The first part of the pathway leading to formation of queuosine, up to the intermediate |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, is described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6703|. 
/
/|FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE "PreQ<sub>0</sub>"| is a common intermediate, and is also found in the pathways leading to the biosynthesis of several 7-deazapurine antibiotics produced by <i>Streptomyces</i> species.  Before it can be inserted into a tRNA, it is converted into |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-3501|.  This enzyme uses two NADPH molecules to reduce the nitrile group of |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE| to an amino group |CITS: [15767583]|.  The next enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX0-1101|, catalyzes a complex reaction in which |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| is transferred into a target tRNA molecule, replacing the guanine base with the 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine group at position 34 |CITS: [8323579]|.  The enzyme recognizes the anticodon region of its substrate, and only acts on tRNAs that contain a GUN sequence |CITS: [8494901]|.
/
/The next enzyme, |FRAME: EG10812-MONOMER|, transfers a ribose moiety from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| to the 7-aminomethyl group of |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, resulting in the formation of the 2,3-epoxy-4,5-dihydroxycyclopentane ring of epoxyqueuosine and releasing |FRAME: ADENINE| and |FRAME: MET| |CITS: [8347586][7849103]|.  In the last step of the pathway, the eopxy bonds are reduced, generating the final queuosine residue.  The reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: G7843-MONOMER| |CITS: [21502530]|.

CITATIONS - 20693992:EV-EXP-IDA:3491083275:caspi
COMMENT - |FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is an essential cofactor for carboxyl group transfer enzymes such as
/|FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, and is required by all forms of life |CITS: [ColiSalII]|. 
/
/Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years. The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in E. coli |CITS: [20693992]|.
/
/Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure. The early steps of the pathway describe the synthesis of the precursor pimelate, and are described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6519|. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described here.
/
/The first step in this part of the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: EG10117|-encoded |FRAME: DAPASYN-CPLX| |CITS: [1092681][1092682][12379100]|. This product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, the |FRAME: EG10120|-encoded |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|. This enzye catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not
/require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.
/
/The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10118|.
/This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction.  It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i>, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the
/source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|. However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Folates are tripartite molecules comprising pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pABA), and glutamate moieties.  In natural folates the pterin ring exists in the dihydro or tetrahydro state.  Folate usually has a gamma-linked polyglutamyl tail of up to eight residues attached to the first glutamate.  The one-carbon units (methyl or formyl) are either attached to the N-5 of the pterin moiety, to the N-10 of the pABA moiety or bridged in between these two (e.g., 5,10-methenyl or methylene-THF).  10-formyl-tetrahydrofolates are involved in tetrahydrofolate, purine and formate synthesis |CITS: [7868604][17645794]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The formation of the formyl and methyl derivatives of tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) directly involved in or representing side steps of the biosynthesis of this vital cofactor is displayed in this pathway.  Conversion of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate occurs either directly through hydrolysis or via 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate in several steps |CITS: [7868604][17645794]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> 4-aminobenzoate (<i>p</i>-aminobenzoate) is an important metabolic intermediate that is biosynthesized from chorismate. Chorismate itself is a key metabolic branch point intermediate produced by the common pathway of aromatic biosynthesis, and is a metabolic precursor for many other pathways (as shown in the pathway links from pathway |FRAME: ARO-PWY|). 4-Aminobenzoate is a precursor of folates, as shown in the pathway link.  Folates are involved in several important metabolic functions such as synthesis of methionine, pantothenate, purines and thymidylates (for example see pathways |FRAME: HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY|, |FRAME: PANTO-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-6123| and |FRAME: PWY0-166|). Folates are tripartite molecules composed of a pterin moiety, a 4-aminobenzoate unit, and a &gamma;-linked glutamate chain.
/
/As indicated by the pathway synonyms, in plants folate biosynthesis is segregated into three subcellular compartments, with the 4-aminobenzoate moiety produced in the plastids |CITS: [15500462][14745019]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In early work, <i>E. coli</i> K-12 mutant strains requiring 4-aminobenzoate for growth were isolated, analyzed, and genes <i>pabA</i> and <i>pabB</i> were identified. These two genes were thought to be responsible for 4-aminobenzoate synthesis in a single step |CITS: [5337773][4914080]|. Later work revised this, showing that the PabAB enzyme forms the intermediate 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate and a second enzyme, aminodeoxychorismate lyase, catalyzes the conversion of this intermediate to 4-aminobenzoate |CITS: [2656685][2251281]|. The identity of the 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate product of PabAB was confirmed and the second enzyme was designated PabC |CITS: [ANDERSONK91]|. The <i>pabC</i> gene was later cloned and its product was characterized |CITS: [2071583][1644759]|.  
/
/In this pathway PabA and PabB form a 1:1 heterodimeric complex that catalyzes the conversion of chorismate and glutamine to 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate. PabA functions as a glutaminase, but only when in complex with PabB. PabA alone is inactive and is therefore a conditional glutaminase that is activated by complex formation with PabB. PabB is an aminodeoxychorismate synthase that utilizes chorismate, and the nacent ammonia derived from glutamine hydrolysis by PabA, as substrates. PabC is a lyase that catalyzes the cleavage and aromatization of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate to produce 4-aminobenzoate and pyruvate |CITS: [1637823][ANDERSONK91][2251281]|.

COMMENT - Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and 
/mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states.
/These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, 
/formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. 
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme
/|FRAME:DIHYDROFOLATESYNTH-ENZRXN| (encoded in <i>E. coli</i> by |FRAME:EG10327|) adds a glutamate
/residue to 7,8-dihydropteroate, resulting in 7,8-dihydrofolate, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>.
/This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:DIHYDROFOLATEREDUCT-ENZRXN|
/(FolA) to tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or THF).
/THF can then be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
/folate polyglutamtes (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates).  Most of the glutamates are added by 
/&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate 
/or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by 
/peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds. 
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized 
/dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/Apparently, the glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, 
/it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in 
/mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis 
/|CITS: [10598551]|.
/Folylpolyglutamates are generally better substrates for folate-dependent enzymes than their monoglutamyl 
/counterparts. Km values decrease with increasing oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain length |CITS: [2688305]|.
/At least in one case, the vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-independent methionine synthetase, there is an absolute 
/requirement for the polyglutamate cofactor |CITS: [2985605]|.
/
/In addition, many folate enzymes are multifunctional and channel one-carbon units between reactions without 
/achieving equilibrium with the cell medium. Therefore, the conjugated oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain 
/can potentially regulate the reaction rates, and allows channeling of the substrate between enzymes in a way which 
/controls biosynthetic pathways |CITS: [2688305]|.
/
/
/Folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of folates to 
/polyglutamates, has been purified from several organisms, including <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [2985605]|.
/It is a MgATP-dependent enzyme present in all cells. FPGS forms a complex with MgATP, a folate derivative, 
/and glutamate, in an ordered manner whereby the three substrates are added sequentially |CITS: [11501996]|. 
/In <i>E. coli</i>, FPGS is a bi-functional enzyme, which also catalyzes the addition of glutamate 
/to 7,8-dihydropteroate, generating 7,8,-dihydrofolate (dihydrofolate synthetase, (E.C# 6.3.2.12). 
/
/In exponentially growing cells of <i>E. coli</i> folylpoly-&gamma;- glutamates have short glutamate chain lengths: 
/mono- and triglutamate derivatives are most abundant, with tetra-, penta- and hexaglutamate derivatives 
/also present (in order of decreasing abundance). However, in stationary phase, cells contain longer-chain-length 
/folypolyglutamates, with the predominant chain length containing six or seven  glutamyl residues.
/These longer chains are generated by a second enzyme, which adds glutamate moieties in &alpha;-linkage to 
/tetrahydropteroyl- triglutamates |CITS: [3536926]|. However, this enzyme has not been purified, 
/nor has the gene encoding it been identified. 
/
/Both folylpolyglutamate synthetases can accept several different folate derivatives as substrates. It seems that
/the preferred substrate for the addition of a second glutamate residue is 10-formyl-THF 
/(10-formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>), while the preferred substrate for the addition of a third glutamate
/residue is the glutamated form of 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-methylene-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>2</sub>).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b> 
/
/Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9, tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate) and its derivatives are commonly termed folates. Folates are tripartite molecules made up of a pterin, 4-aminobenzoate, and L-glutamate moieties. The pterin is synthesized from GTP and 4-aminobenzoate is synthesized from chorismate as shown in the pathway links to |FRAME: PWY-6147| and |FRAME: PWY-6543|, respectively.
/
/The product of this pathway, tetrahydrofolate, is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions, and the number of glutamate residues. The glutamate residues are conjugated one to another via a series of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail, as shown in the pathway link to |FRAME: PWY-2161|.
/
/Folates are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways. In <i>E. coli</i> folates lead to the biosynthesis of methionine, purines, thymidylate and pantothenate (see pathways |FRAME: HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-6123|, |FRAME: PWY0-166|, and |FRAME: PANTO-PWY|). They also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine (see pathway |FRAME: GLYSYN-PWY|) and participate in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: N-formyl-L-methionyl-tRNAfmet|. Folates are biosynthesized <i>de novo</i> by bacteria, fungi and plants. Vertebrates are dependent on nutritional sources of folate, making it a vitamin. In addition to the <i>de novo</i> pathway, many organisms also possess salvage pathways that are used to re-synthesize tetrahydrofolate from pre-existing derivatives of folates in the cell (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6613|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Dihydropteroate synthase encoded by <i>folP</i> catalyzes the condensation of 4-aminobenzoate (<i>p</i>-aminobenzoate) with 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate to produce 7,8-dihydropteroate (dihydropteroate) |CITS: [4304228]|. Sulfonamide derivatives (sulfa drugs) are structural analogs of 4-aminobenzoate that compete with this substrate for the enzyme. Several mechanisms of sulfonamide resistance can develop, including mutations in <i>folP</i> |CITS: [9449266][8304179]|. 
/
/Dihydrofolate synthetase encoded by <i>folC</i> then catalyzes the synthesis of dihydrofolate from dihydropteroate, L-glutamate and ATP |CITS: [14114858]|. In <i>E. coli</i> FolC is a bifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes subsequent additions of L-glutamate to tetrahydrofolate (folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamate synthetase activity) |CITS: [2985605]| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-2161|). The <i>folC</i> gene has been shown to be essential in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [1548226]|.
/
/Dihydrofolate reductase encoded by <i>folA</i> is the major enzyme responsible for reducing 7,8-dihydrofolate monoglutamate (dihydrofolate) to physiologically active tetrahydrofolate. Its substrate dihydrofolate is also a product of |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX| encoded by <i>thyA</i> during <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine biosynthesis (|FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-RXN|). Because |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX| utilizes both the tetrahydrofolate derivative 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and dUMP as substrates, dihydrofolate reductase must quickly reduce dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate when thymidylate is being synthesized in order to maintain cellular stores of tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/Strains containing a deletion of <i>folA</i> have been isolated from <i>thyA</i> strains, suggesting the existence of another enzyme with dihydrofolate reductase activity. FolM is considered to be a candidate for this |CITS: [14617668]|, although its physiological role is incompletely understood.  Another candidate was suggested to be |FRAME: DIHYDROPTERIREDUCT-CPLX| encoded by <i>nfsB</i> which was reported to have dihydrofolate reductase activity |CITS: [1418677]|, although more studies are needed to support this.

COMMENT - Riboflavin is the precursor for the essential flavin cofactors FMN and FAD, which are used in a wide variety of redox reactions.  Riboflavin is also known as vitamin B2, because it is an essential nutrient and can not be synthesized by mammals.
/
/The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway and its enzymes are not yet entirely understood.  Enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation of |FRAME: CPD-1086| were long unknown, and only recently at least two enzymes were shown to catalyze this reaction |CITS: [24123841]|.  The only experimental data on the bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both the riboflavin kinase reaction, generating FMN from riboflavin, and the FMN adenylyltransferase reaction, generating FAD from FMN, have been published in a patent application |CITS: [Kitatsuji93]|.

CITATIONS - 22126997:EV-EXP-TAS:3639774566:amackie
COMMENT - The peptidoglycan (PG) or murein sacculus of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 is assembled from monomer subunits of the disaccharide pentapeptide, <i>N</i>-acetyl-(<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl)muramoyl-L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-<I>meso</I>-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (also known as GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide) which are synthesized in the cytoplasm as lipid linked molecules (lipid II) and then flipped across the inner membrane by a flippase protein (see |FRAME: PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|). Mature peptidoglycan is assembled on the outer face of the inner membrane through the action of transglycosylases, transpeptidases and peptidoglycan hydrolases. 
/
/Peptidoglycan is a heterogeneous polymer; the length of mature glycan strands varies |CITS: [2285138][3292521]| - the average degree of oligomerization is about 25 to 40 disaccharide units |CITS: [17658458]| - and may be affected by growth conditions. The length of the peptide stem also varies - di-, tri-, tetra- and pentapeptide muropeptides have all been identified - as have different levels of cross-linkage from monomeric peptides to tetrameric peptides |CITS: [3292521]|. Growing glycan chains remain linked to the lipid carrier (<i>di-trans,octa-cis</i>-undecaprenyl phosphate); the terminal residues of released strands are GlcNAc and 1,6-anyhdroMurNAc |CITS: [357]| however the mechanism resulting in release remains unknown - the  7 lytic transglycosylases which cleave PG producing 1,6-anyhdroMurNAc muropeptides during PG recycling and turnover do not seem to be involved (see |CITS: [22126997]|. Recently an inner membrane protein, |FRAME: EG11494-MONOMER "MltG"|, with endolytic transglycosylase activity has been characterised which may function as a peptidoglycan terminase |CITS: [26507882]|
/
/Transglycosylases catalyse the formation of a &beta;1 &rarr; 4 N-acetylmuramoyl-N-acetylglucosamine bond between a growing glycan chain and a newly flipped disaccharide pentapeptide monomer releasing a molecule of <i>di-trans,octa-cis</i>-undecaprenyl diphosphate (UPP) for recycling in the process. It is not clear whether the growing glycan chain serves as glycosyl donor and the disaccharide monomer as acceptor or vice versa; evidence for the former has been presented (|CITS: [16351056]|). Transpeptidases cross link glycan strands within newly synthesized peptidoglycan and between newly made material and preexisting peptidoglycan; they also link peptidoglycan to Braun's lipoprotein (Lpp) in the outer membrane and catalyse the exchange of carboxy terminal D-alanine residues with glycine in the peptide stem. 
/
/DD-transpeptidases catalyse the cross-linking of the glycan strands between the the D-alanine at position 4 of a pentapeptide stem and the meso-diaminopimelyl residue (m-A<sub>2</sub>pm) at position 3 of a separate tetrapeptide stem (a D-Ala &rarr; m-A<sub>2</sub>pm cross-link); LD transpeptidases catalyse the cross link between two m-A<sub>2</sub>pm residues of separate stems. <i>E. coli K-12</i> contains bifunctional transglycosylases/DD transpeptidases (|FRAME: CPLX0-7717 "MrcA"| also known as penicillin binding protein 1A or PBP1A, |FRAME: CPLX0-3951 "MrcB"|/PBP1B and |FRAME: G7322-MONOMER "PbpC"|/PBP1C) |CITS: [7006606][16840781][7001458][10542235]|, monofunctional DD transpeptidases (|FRAME: EG10606-MONOMER "MrdA"|/PBP2, |FRAME: EG10341-MONOMER "FtsI"|/PBP3) |CITS: [6297485][3531167]|, a monofunctional transglycosylase (|FRAME: G7668-MONOMER "MtgA"|) |CITS: [8772200]| and 2 LD transpeptidases (|FRAME: EG11253-MONOMER "LdtD"| and |FRAME: G6904-MONOMER "LdtE"|) which form m-A<sub>2</sub>pm &rarr; m-A<sub>2</sub>pm cross links within peptidoglycan |CITS: [18456808]|.  A further three LD-transpeptidases (|FRAME: G7073-MONOMER "LdtA"|, |FRAME: G6571-MONOMER "LdtC"| and |FRAME: G6422-MONOMER "LdtB"|) cleave the m-A<sub>2</sub>pm-d-Ala peptide bond of a peptidoglycan donor stem and link the m-A<sub>2</sub>pm residue to the the C-terminal lysine residue of Braun's lipoprotein and catalyse the exchange of D-alanine with glycine in tetrapeptide stems |CITS: [17369299][18456808]|.   
/
/The murein of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 is characterised by the presence of 'free' penta-, tetra-, and tripeptide stems (ie. stems not involved in cross linkages) in varying proportions. Pentapeptide stems are converted to tetrapeptides by the action of DD carboxypeptidases (primarily |FRAME: EG10201-MONOMER "DacA or PBP5"|) which remove the C-terminal D-alanine residue |CITS: [7002918]| while tripeptide stems are formed by cleavage of the (L)-<i>meso</i>-A<sub>2</sub>pm &rarr;D-Ala bond of tetrapeptide stems. This latter reaction is catalysed by the LD-transpeptidase enzymes (LdtA, LdtB, LdtC, LdtD and LdtE) which also have LD-carboxypeptidase activity |CITS: [18456808]|. The amount of dipeptide subunits in isolated murein is low and the mechanism by which they might be formed is not clear.
/
/Please note: This pathway has been designed to include many of the reactions that are involved during the assembly of nascent peptidoglycan but the heterogeneous nature of the mature polymer precludes depiction by a single pathway. This pathway does not depict the insertion of newly made peptidoglycan into the existing sacculus - several models for this process have been proposed (see |CITS: [17658458]|). The insertion of new material requires cleavage of mature peptidoglycan and <i>E. coli</i> contains a variety of peptidoglycan hydrolases which cleave the glycoside and amide bonds of mature peptidoglycan (reviewed in |CITS: [22126997]|). There is a significant turnover of peptidoglycan during cell growth and this is accompanied by recycling of the turnover products for reuse (see |FRAME: PWY0-1261| and |FRAME: PWY0-1546|).

COMMENT - Synthesis of peptidoglycan in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 is a complex process which occurs across two cell compartments. This pathway describes the first stage of this process - the cytoplasmic synthesis of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide (a nucleotide activated monosaccharide-peptide) from the essential peptidoglycan precursor UDP-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine. 
/
/The first reaction of this pathway, an <i>enol</i>pyruvyl transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the C3-hydroxyl group of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, is catalysed by MurA |CITS: [1512209]|. The product of this reaction, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate, is then reduced to UDP-N-acetyl-muramate (UDP-MurNAc) in a reaction catalysed by the NADPH dependent flavoprotein MurB |CITS: [8448160]|. The final 4 steps of the pathway result in attachment of a pentapeptide stem to the lactyl group of UDP-MurNAc to form a UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (specifically UDP-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-muramoyl-L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-<I>meso</I>-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine). The composition of the pentapeptide stem varies within bacterial species (see |CITS: [18194336]|); in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 the pentapeptide is formed by successive addition of L-alanine, D-glutamate, <i>meso</i>-diaminopimelic acid (m-A<sub>2</sub>pm) and a D-alanyl-alanine dipeptide catalysed by the MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF ligases respectively |CITS: [7601127][1765076][2269304][2186811]|. The pentapeptide stem contains several rare D-amino acids formed from their corresponding L-enantiomers through the action of amino acid racemases - alanine racemase I and II and glutamate racemase. 
/
/In a subsequent pathway (see |FRAME: PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|), the UDP-MurNAC-pentapeptide is transformed by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine and a lipid carrier molecule to form Lipid II (<i>ditrans,octacis</i>-undecaprenyldiphospho-<i>N</i>-acetyl-(<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl)muramoyl-L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-<i>meso</i>-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine) which is the monomer unit transported across the inner membrane for peptidoglycan maturation (described in |FRAME: PWY0-1586|).
/
/The enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth and are thus attractive targets for antibacterial drug development (see for example reviews by |CITS: [12492849][17692001][21261855][21822642]|).

COMMENT - The L-serine degradation pathway consists of a single step conversion
/of L-serine to pyruvate and ammonia.
/
/Serine is not a typical carbon source for the cell. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
/two of the three serine deaminases involved in this pathway are known
/to be expressed only in the absence of glucose.
/
/Although only one of the three primary serine deaminases has been shown to be
/expressed solely under anaerobic conditions, all three enzymes
/rely on catalytically critical iron-sulfur clusters that are oxygen sensitive,
/suggesting that this pathway can only work in the absence of oxygen. This
/concept is bolstered by the fact that the bifunctional threonine/serine deaminase,
/TdcB, is also expressed only in the absence of oxygen.

/is repressed by abundant methionine. <i>thrA</i> is regulated by threonine- and isoleucine-dependent
/attenuation, and both the aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities of ThrA are
/inhibited by threonine. The middle enzymatic activity, aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, is subject
/to some form of repression by both methionine and threonine.

CITATIONS - 16077126:EV-EXP-IDA:3378069203:caspi
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Methylglyoxal is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via dihydroxyacetone phosphate), fatty acid metabolism (via acetone) and protein metabolism (via aminoacetone).  Methylglyoxal is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see |CITS: [10597025]| for a review).  There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds.  These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> there are several pathways for the removal of methylglyoxal. In this pathway, methylglyoxal is reduced to acetol by the action of various enzymes possessing methylglyoxal reductase activity. Most of the enzymes that have been characterized with this activity belong to the NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase subfamily of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. AKRs are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and catalyze the reduction of carbonyl-containing aldehyde and/or ketone containing compounds to their corresponding alcohols. A few dual-specificity AKRs are also able to utilize NADH. An AKR from <i>E. coli</i> has been identified that is NADH-specific (AKR11B2, the product of gene <i>ydjG</i>). AKRs have been of considerable interest in metabolic engineering studies |CITS: [16813561]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> K-12 enzymes homologous to mammalian AKRs have been shown to catalyze the methylglyoxal reductase reaction |CITS: [16077126]|. Overexpression of the aldo-keto reductase AKR14A1, encoded by the |FRAME:G7558| gene, leads to increased resistance to methylglyoxal |CITS: [12583903]|. In addition, three other genes |FRAME:G6967| (<i>yeaE</i>), |FRAME:G7565| (<i>yqhE</i>), and |FRAME:EG11648| (<i>yafB</i>) were shown to encode proteins with similar activities. All four proteins were purified, and shown to catalyze the reaction <i>in vitro</i>, in the presence of NADPH |CITS:[16077126]|.
/
/Prolonged incubation of <i>E. coli</i> cell-free extracts with methylglyoxal resulted in conversion of acetol to (<i>S</i>)-propane-1,2-diol. The enzyme proposed to catalyze (<i>S</i>)-propane-1,2-diol production is |FRAME:GLYCDEH-CPLX| |CITS: [6183251][3920199]|. In bacteria (<i>S</i>)-propane-1,2-diol is a dead-end metabolite and exits the cell rapidly |CITS: [2644239]|.
/
/Although AKRs can reduce methylglyoxal to acetol, a |FRAME: METHYLGLYREDUCT-MONOMER| encoded by an unknown gene was purified from <i>E. coli</i> and shown to convert methylglyoxal to lactaldehyde (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5459|).

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, the glutathione-dependent glyoxalase system is probably the most common pathway that catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal to a less toxic product.  In the pathway shown here, methylglyoxal is converted to (<i>R</i>)-lactate via the intermediate (<i>S</i>)-lactoyl-glutathione by two glyoxylase enzymes.  |FRAME: GLYOXI-CPLX| (GloA) isomerizes the hemithioacetal that is formed non-enzymatically from methylglyoxal and glutathione to (<i>S</i>)-lactoyl-glutathione.  Glyoxalase II enzymes, mainly |FRAME: GLYOXII-MONOMER GloB| with a minor contribution from |FRAME: G6475-MONOMER GloC|, hydrolyze the thioester to (<i>R</i>)-lactate, regenerating the glutathione in the process |CITS: [25670698]|.  In addition, |FRAME: CPLX0-3954 YeiG| can catalyze the hydrolysis of <i>S</i>-lactoylglutathione and may also be involved in the detoxification of endogenous methylglyoxal |CITS: [16567800]|.
/
/This system not only involves the enzymes encoded by the unlinked genes <i>gloA</i>, <i>gloB</i> and <i>gloC</i>, but also their integration with the glutathione adduct-gated |FRAME: KEFB-MONOMER "KefGB K<sup>+</sup> efflux system"|.  Studies of a &Delta;<i>gloB</i> mutant supported a model that includes activation of KefGB by <i>S</i>-lactoylglutathione resulting in K<sup>+</sup> efflux and H<sup>+</sup> influx.  This lowering of cytoplasmic pH also protects against methylglyoxal damage |CITS: [21143325]|. 
/
/The fate of (<i>R</i>)-lactate is less well characterized.  It can be excreted or further metabolized |CITS: [21143325]|.  In the latter case it may be converted to pyruvate by the action of D-lactate dehydrogenase, a flavoprotein specific to the D-form of lactate |CITS: [10944213]|.

COMMENT - It has been said that no biological compound functions in as many different types of biological reactions
/as |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (known as SAM or AdoMet).  It is probably second only to ATP
/in the variety of reactions for which it serves as a cofactor.  SAM is found in all living organisms, and fulfills
/three important roles:
/
/*  In transmethylation, SAM is the principal biological methyl donor.
/
/*  In transsulfuration, the sulfur atom of the SAM molecule is converted via a series of enzymatic steps to
/cysteine, a precursor of taurine and glutathione, a major cellular anti-oxidant.
/
/*  In polyamine biosynthesis, SAM is the donor of aminopropyl groups.
/
/The structure of SAM was first elucidated by Cantoni in 1951 |CITS: [14832232]|.  The key to SAM's
/activity lies in the presence of the high energy sulfonium ion, which activates each of the attached carbons
/toward nucleophilic attack.  In most cases, SAM reacts by transfer of the S-methyl group to a long list of
/possible acceptors in transmethylation reactions.
/
/SAM is synthesized in the cytosol of every cell from |FRAME: MET| and |FRAME: ATP|; in <i>E. coli</i>,
/the reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: S-ADENMETSYN-CPLX|.  In this unusual reaction, the adenosyl
/moiety of ATP is transferred to methionine, forming a sulfonium ion which is a high energy reagent that can
/easily transfer its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor substrates including nucleic acids, proteins,

TYPES - Activation
TYPES - Sulfur-Metabolism
COMMON-NAME - sulfate activation for sulfonation
CITATIONS - ROBBINS56
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The sulfonation of biological compounds (sulfoconjugation) is a fundamental metabolic process, in which a sulfate group is added to an oxygen moiety to form a sulfate ester bond. The sulfonation of biomolecules occurs widely and results in a dramatic change in the physicochemical property of the sulfonated compounds |CITS: [Huxtable86]|. Sulfonation, is widely observed from bacteria to humans and plays a key role in various biological processes such as cell communication, growth and development, and defense |CITS: [11396917]|
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must be activated prior to being transferred to an acceptor molecule |CITS: [13851709]|. The known forms of activated sulfate are adenosine 5-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulfate (PAPS) |CITS: [2828368]|. 
/
/Enzymatic reduction of sulfate requires its prior activation to a phosphosulfate-mixed anhydride, which in <i>E. coli</i> occurs through the ATP sulfurylase-catalyzed reaction of sulfate with ATP to give adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and PPi |CITS: [13575437]|. A second enzyme, APS kinase, phosphorylates APS with another ATP to give 3'-phosphoadenylsulfate (PAPS) |CITS: [Robbins56]|, which is then enzymatically reduced by PAPS sulfotransferase (also known as PAPS reductase) to sulfite. 
/
/ATP sulfurylase is encoded by <i>cysD</i> and <i>cysN</i>, and APS kinase is encoded by <i>cysC</i> with all three genes located in the <i>cys</i>DNC cluster |CITS: [2828368][1316900][3275623]|. The <i>E. coli</i> ATP sulfurylase enzyme has two nonidentical subunits, a 35-kDa catalytic subunit encoded by <i>cysD</i> and a 53-kDa peptide encoded by <i>cysN</i> |CITS: [2828368][1316900]|. The native enzyme is thought to contain four each of the two different subunits |CITS: [8117661]|. GTP stimulates the rate of APS synthesis as much as 116-fold with an apparent K<sub>m</sub> of 19 &micro;M and is hydrolyzed in the process |CITS: [1730615]|. When coupled with APS synthesis, GTP hydrolysis lowers the apparent K<sub>eq</sub> for the overall reaction by a factor of about 10<sup>5</sup> |CITS: [8299360][9521709]|. The enzyme mechanism involves the GTP-dependent formation of an AMP-enzyme reaction intermediate, which then undergoes nucleophilic attack by sulfate to give APS |CITS: [8117661]|. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> APS kinase is composed of identical 22-kDa peptides encoded by <i>cysC</i> |CITS: [2828368][1316900][1332767]|. The peptide subunit is phosphorylated by ATP at Ser-109 |CITS: [1332767]| and exists as a dimer in the phosphorylated state and mostly as a tetramer in the unphosphorylated state |CITS: [2549047]|. The phosphorylated enzyme probably represents an intermediate on the reaction pathway and can donate its phosphate either to APS to give the product PAPS or to ADP to re-form the substrate ATP.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can utilize alkanesulfonates as a sulfur source for growth.  Utilization of alkanesulfonate as well as |FRAME: CPD-3746| and |FRAME: L-CYSTEATE| requires the two-component alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system consisting of an NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase and an FMN-dependent alkanesulfonate monooxygenase |CITS: [10480865][11750815]|.
/
/Flavin cofactors are usually bound to proteins through strong covalent or non-covalent interactions; in this system, however, the flavin serves as a substrate for both enzymes and is not bound as a prosthetic group.  Thus, the transfer of the reduced flavin between the FMN reductase and the monooxygenase must be tightly controlled to prevent generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide, or hydroxyl radicals.  Recent studies showed kinetic interactions between the FMN reductase and the monooxygenase |CITS: [15882995]| and the formation of a stable complex between the two enzymes |CITS: [16997955]|.  These results support a model for direct transfer of the reduced flavin.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>
/
/The amino acid glutamine is a constituent of proteins and a nitrogen donor for many biosynthetic reactions, 
/including the biosynthesis of amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, glucosamime and carbamoyl phosphate.  The 
/biosynthesis of glutamine is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase, a key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism found in 
/all domains of life.  Phylogenetic analysis of glutamine synthetase genes has suggested that they are among the 
/oldest functioning genes in the history of evolution |CITS: [8096645]|.  In microorganisms and plants, glutamine 
/synthetase (also known as GS) has a role in ammonia assimilation in combination with glutamate synthase 
/(glutamine: &alpha;-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, or GOGAT) as indicated by the pathway links and pathways 
/|FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-3282|).  This is known as the GS/GOGAT pathway 
/|CITS: [GOTTSCHALK1986]|.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/This pathway serves as a major mechanism of ammonia assimilation during nitrogen limitation. It has only one reaction, which is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase. There are three types of glutamine synthetase, differing in number of subunits. Glutamine synthetase type I is found mostly in bacteria and archaea, including <i>E. coli</i> (reviewed in |CITS: [11585846]|). It is a well-studied homododecamer built from two back-to-back hexameric rings |CITS: [5336023][242004][241853][3654][28418]|. The enzyme contains two metal-binding sites (n1 and n2) to which Mg2+ or Mn2+ can bind. Binding at the n1 site leads to stabilization of the protein and facilitates the binding of glutamate to the catalytic site, whereas metal binding to the n2 site is implicated in phosphoryl transfer (reviewed in: Stadtman E. R (2004) "Regulation of Glutamine Synthetase Activity." EcoSal 3.6.1.6 |CITS: [ecosal]|.

COMMON-NAME - 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 4928016:EV-EXP-IMP:3547927654:fulcher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Iron is an essential trace element. In the presence of oxygen, ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) which forms insoluble compounds that are not available to bacteria. As a result, the level of physiologically available iron can drop to low levels and become growth-limiting. To survive, many bacteria evolved specialized transport systems for low molecular weight iron chelating compounds called siderophores which form complexes with Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Amino acid conjugates of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate make up a major class of siderophores, including enterobactin, bacillibactin and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylglycine.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> produces only one siderophore, enterobactin which is a cyclic triester of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine. It is transported by the |FRAME: EG10293-MONOMER| which imports Fe3<sup>+</sup> chelated to enterobactin into the cell. Enterobactin biosynthesis in unnecessary under anaerobic conditions when iron is in the soluble Fe<sup>2+</sup> form.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As indicated in the first the pathway link, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is synthesized from chorismate via isochorismate and 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoate. Chorismate is a key intermediate and branch point in the biosynthesis of many aromatic compounds. As shown in the second pathway link, three molecules of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate are combined with three molecules of L-serine by the |FRAME: ENTMULTI-CPLX| to form enterobactin. Isochorismate is both a precursor of enterobactin via isochorismate synthase EntC, and a precursor of menaquinol-8 via isochorismate synthase MenF. Menaquinol-8 is required under anaerobic conditions (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5837| and subsequent pathway links).
/
/The biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate from chorismate is catalyzed by three enzymes EntC, EntB, and EntA. EntC catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate. The N-terminal isochorismate lyase domain of EntB hydrolyzes the pyruvate group of isochorismate to produce 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. The conversion of this latter compound to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is catalyzed by the EntA dehydrogenase.
/
/Gene <i>ryhB</i> encodes a small RNA that promotes enterobactin biosynthesis via posttranscriptional mechanisms. It is required for normal expression of the <i>entCEBAH</i> transcription unit, and it also represses translation of the <i>cysE</i> encoded |FRAME: CPLX0-237| thereby allowing L-serine to be used in enterobactin biosynthesis |CITS: [20696910]|.

UNIQUE-ID - COBALSYN-PWY
TYPES - B12-Salvage-From-Cobinamide
COMMON-NAME - adenosylcobalamin salvage from cobinamide I
CITATIONS - 7592411:EV-EXP-IMP:3522022109:amackie
COMMENT - The B12 group of coenzymes is defined by the presence of a corrin ring structure which consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by 4 pyrrole groups, an upper (&beta;) axial ligand and a lower (&alpha;) axial ligand. This pathway depicts the synthesis of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), containing 5'-deoxyadenosine as the &beta; ligand and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) as the &alpha; ligand. Other physiologically relevant forms of coenzyme B12 with different &alpha; and &beta; ligands have been described (for example |FRAME: CPD-9037|, |FRAME: CPD0-1256| and |FRAME: CPD-17189|) (reviewed in |CITS: [12195810]|.
/
/<i>De novo</i> synthesis of cobamides requires a great deal of genetic information, which is only found in some prokaryotes. <i>E. coli</i> K-12 does not have the full genetic information required for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, but can synthesize AdoCbl when supplied with exogenous corrinoids, such as |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| (Cbi) - an incomplete corrinoid that lacks the upper and lower axial ligands and is not a true intermediate of the <i>de novo</i> pathway |CITS: [14351147][8770581]|.
/
/This pathway and its enzymes are largely uncharacterized in <i>E. coli</i>.  The enzymes involved have been studied more closely in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> which can synthesize coenzyme B12 <i>de novo</i> under anaerobic conditions but requires supplementation with an incomplete corrinoid such as cobinamide under aerobic conditions (reviewed in |CITS: [8905078]|. 
/
/Exogneous corrinoids (including cobalamin and cobinamide) are transported across the cell envelope by the TonB dependent outer membrane protein |FRAME: EG10126-MONOMER "BtuB"| and the inner membrane ABC transporter |FRAME: ABC-5-CPLX "BtuCDF"|. Attachment of the &beta; or upper ligand, 5' deoxyadenosine, is catalysed by the <i>btuR</i> encoded protein which yields |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE| (AdoCbi) - a substrate of the bifunctional kinase and guanylyltransferase encoded by <i>cobU</i>. The route for synthesis of the &alpha; or lower ligand, DMB, in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 is unknown although it has been suggested that CobT is a bifunctional enzyme with a role in both synthesis and activation of the lower ligand |CITS: [7883701]|. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, the physiologically relevent form of cobamide in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions may be pseudo-adenosylcobamide which contains adenine as a lower ligand |CITS: [10648108], [17981976], [18083805]| raising the possibility that this is also the situation in <i>E. coli</i>.     
/
/<i>E. coli</i> is also capable of |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN "cobalamin"| (a cobamide whose lower ligand is DMB) transport into the cell, with subsequent BtuR catalysed transfer of an adenosyl moiety to yield adenosylcobalamin.  The adenosyl donor by either route is ATP |CITS: [8550510][7592411][ColiSalII]|.

TYPES - Pyrimidine-Nucleotide-Salvage
COMMON-NAME - pyrimidine ribonucleosides salvage I
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in this salvage pathway is uridine-cytidine kinase (also known as uridine kinase, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.48 "EC 2.7.1.48"|). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the nucleosides |FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE| to their monophosphate forms.
/
/The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, plants and animals, although some differences exists among the enzymes. For example, the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-562| prefers GTP as the phosphate donor |CITS: [211379]|, while the mammalian enzyme prefers ATP. 
/
/Another enzyme that participates in the salvage of nucleosides is cytidine deaminase (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.5 "EC 3.5.4.5"|). It has been shown in |FRAME: TAX-562| that exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is not directly converted to CMP. Instead, a very active |FRAME: CYTIDEAM-CPLX| converts it rapidly to |FRAME: URIDINE|, which is phosphorylated to UMP, and eventually converted to UTP and CTP. However, exogenously supplied cytidine will be phosphorylated to CMP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in the salvage of the pyrimidine nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| is uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) (|FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "EC 2.4.2.9"|), which transfers a phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to uracil, generating |FRAME: UMP| in a single step.

/
/Mammals lack the enzyme, and thereby are unable to perform the one-step salvage of uracil |CITS: [15685165]| and are limited to recycling pyrimidine nucleosides via uridine kinases (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|).

/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway, the pyrimidine nucleoside |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is first hydrolyzed to the nucleobase |FRAME: CYTOSINE| by removal of the ribose sugar by the enzyme |FRAME: YDR400W-MONOMER "ribonucleoside nucleosidase"| (|FRAME: EC-3.2.2.3 "EC 3.2.2.3"|). Cytosine is then deaminated by |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.1 "cytosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.1)"| to the pyrimidine base |FRAME: URACIL| |CITS: [10024464][10469156]|.
/
/The resulting uracil base can be salvaged to form a pyrimidine nucleotide (see |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7193|). Alternatively, uracil can be degraded to |FRAME: B-ALANINE| by releasing NH<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in a three step reductive pathway (|FRAME: PWY-3982|). &beta;-Alanine is a precursor of pentothenate and coenzyme A.
/
/The overall metabolic outcome of this pathway, the conversion of |FRAME: CYTIDINE| to |FRAME: URACIL|, can also be achieved by a different pathway, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6556|.
/
/Mammals and plants do not have either of the enzymes of this pathway, and thus can not salvage cytosine by this route. Instead they utilize a nucleoside kinase-based pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-7183|). Plants can also salvage pyrimidine nucleosides via the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6556|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2'-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. 
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As shown in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7199|, the deoxyribonucleosides are imported into the cell and phosphorylated by deoxyribonucleoside kinases at the 5' position. The monophosphates are then phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis, as described in this pathway. 
/
/|FRAME: TMP| is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.9 "dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9)"|, while |FRAME: DCMP| is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 "bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)"| and in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 "(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)"|.
/
/Both diphosphates, |FRAME: DUDP| and |FRAME: DCDP|, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"|.

COMMENT - The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (UTP and CTP) can be synthesized <i>de novo</i> (see
/|FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing pyrimidines (uracil and cytosine) or their nucleosides (uridine and
/cytidine) that might be present in the environment.  Any of these four compounds can serve as a total
/source of pyrimidine for both ribonucleoside triphosphates and subsequently for both deoxyribonucleoside
/triphosphates as well (see |FRAME: PWY0-166|).  Exogenously supplied cytosine is rapidly converted to
/uracil and subsequently converted to UMP which flows through a portion of the <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine
/biosynthesis pathway to UTP and CTP. 
/
/Although enzymes are present in <i>E. coli</i> that are capable of converting cytidine directly to CTP, in
/fact exogenously supplied cytidine does not flow through this pathway.  Instead, a very active cytidine
/deaminase converts it rapidly to uridine, which then flows to UTP and then to CTP.  The existence of the
/direct pathway from cytidine to CTP is an accident of the lack of specificity of uridine kinase. 
/Exogenously supplied cytidine will flow directly to CTP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation.  A
/CMP-specific kinase is present in <i>E. coli</i>.  Its purpose is not to utilize externally supplied cytosine. 
/Instead, it is to recover CMP generated intracellularly by the hydrolytic turnover of RNA.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The pathway of cysteine biosynthesis is a two-step conversion starting from
/L-serine and yielding L-cysteine.
/
/This pathway is regulated at the genetic level in its second step, wtih both
/cysteine synthase isozymes being under the positive control of the cysteine-responsive
/transcription factor CysB. It is also subject to very strong feedback inhibition
/of its first step by the final pathway product, cysteine.
/
/Although two cysteine synthase isozymes exist, only cysteine synthase A (CysK) forms
/a complex with serine acetyltransferase. CysK is also the only one of the two
/cysteine synthases that is required for cell viability on cysteine-free medium.
/
/Both steps in this pathway are reversible. Based on genetic and proteomic data,
/it appears that the cysteine synthases may actually act as a sulfur scavenging
/system during sulfur starvation, stripping sulfur off of L-cysteine, generating
/any number of variant amino acids in the process.

COMMON-NAME - L-phenylalanine biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The pathways of biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine are intimately connected.  The first step of
/both pathways is the conversion of chorismate to prephenate; the third step of both is the conversion of a
/ketoacid to an aminoacid through transamination.  The two pathways differ only in the second step of their
/three-step reaction sequences:  In the case of phenylalanine biosynthesis a dehydratase converts
/prephenate to phenylpyruvate (a reaction that occurs slowly in the absence of enzymic acitivity); in the
/case of tyrosine biosynthesis, a dehydrogenase converts prephenate to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.  Also in
/both pathways the first two steps are catalyzed by two distinct active sites on a single protein.  Thus the
/first step of each pathway can be catalyzed by two enzymes: those associated with both the
/phenylalanine-specific dehydratase and the tyrosine-specific dehydrogenase.  Three enzymes, those
/encoded by <i>tyrB</i>, <i>aspC</i>, and <i>ilvE</i>, are involved in catalyzing the third step of these
/pathways: all three can contribute to the synthesis of phenylalanine; only TyrB and AspC contribute to the
/biosynthesis of tyrosine.
/
/Under normal physiological conditions, TyrB is the primary enzyme contributing to the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine.  AspC contributes to their synthesis when substrate pools are large.  The contribution of the <i>ilvE</i>-encoded enzyme to phenylalanine biosynthesis was demonstrated in triple mutants of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 that lacked all three aminotransferases and required both phenylalanine and tyrosine for growth.  However, <i>tyrB</i> and <i>aspC</i> double mutants required only tyrosine for growth |CITS: [15983]|.  This suggested a role for IlvE in phenylalanine biosynthesis in the <i>tyrB</i>, <i>aspC</i> double mutants, although its role in strains with functional TyrB and AspC is unknown.

COMMENT - <b>About this pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, L-cysteine degradation is carried out by L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity (CD) |CITS: [9572924]|. CD is known to catalyze the degradation of L-cysteine to pyruvate, ammonia, and sulfide |CITS: [14907623][13271322][12883870][16000837]|. In <i>E. coli</i>, cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), primarily catalyzes the conversion of cystathionine to homocysteine, pyruvate, and ammonia |CITS: [7049234]| while tryptophanase (TnaA) mainly degrades L-tryptophan to indole, pyruvate, and ammonia |CITS: [14171448]|. Both of them have been shown to exhibit CD activity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [704923][1428472][12883870]|.  
/
/It was recently found that in addition to tryptophanase (TnaA) and cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), three additional proteins exhibit the PLP-dependent-L-cysteine desulfhydrase (CD) activity. These are OAS sulfhydrylase A (CysK), OAS sulfhydrylase B (CysM), and the MalY protein. CysK primarily catalyzes the synthesis of L-cysteine from O-acetylserine and sulfide along the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway. CysM is considered to be an isomer of CysK with unidentified function. MalY protein has activity of the carbon-sulfur bond cleavage (&beta; C-S lyase) of cystathionine. The gene disruption for each protein significantly decreases the CD activity and is effective for overproduction of L-cysteine. The decrease in CD activity for all these genes disruption is reversed in the presence of L-cysteine except for the <i>tnaA</i> gene disruption. This result suggests that TnaA is a key enzyme in L-cysteine degradation in <i>E. coli</i>. Disruption of all the <i>tnaA</i>, <i>metC</i>, <i>cysK</i>, <i>cysM</i> and <i>malY</i> genes together also show much higher CD activity in the presence of L-cysteine than in its absence |CITS: [16000837][16820466]|. Unidentified proteins with CD activity are found, which may be induced by L-cysteine.
/
/Amino acids, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and alanine inhibit the CD activity in <i>E. coli</i>. Alanine, which is most similar to cysteine in configuration, shows the greatest amount of inhibition. Tris- (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, an effective carbonyl agent also caused significant inhibition to the CD activity |CITS: [13271322]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The pathways of biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine are intimately connected. The first step of
/both pathways is the conversion of chorismate to prephenate; the third step of both is the conversion of a
/ketoacid to the aminoacid through transamination.  The two pathways differ only in the second step of
/their three-step reaction sequences:  In the case of phenylalanine biosynthesis a dehydratase converts
/prephenate to phenylpyruvate (a reaction that occurs slowly in the absence of enzymic acitivity); in the
/case of tyrosine biosynthesis, a dehydrogenase converts prephenate to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.  Also in
/both pathways the first two steps are catalyzed by two distinct active sites on a single protein.  Thus the
/first step of each pathway can be catalyzed by two enzymes: those associated with both the
/phenylalanine-specific dehydratase and the tyrosine-specific dehydrogenase.  Three enzymes, those
/encoded by <i>tyrB, aspC</i>, and <i>ilvE</i>, are involved in catalyzing the third step of these
/pathways: all three can contribute to the synthesis of phenylalanine; only TyrB and AspC contribute to the
/biosynthesis of tyrosine.
/
/Under normal physiological conditions, TyrB is the primary enzyme contributing to the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine.  AspC contributes to their synthesis when substrate pools are large.  The contribution of the <i>ilvE</i>-encoded enzyme to phenylalanine biosynthesis was demonstrated in triple mutants of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 that lacked all three aminotransferases and required both phenylalanine and tyrosine for growth.  However, <i>tyrB</i> and <i>aspC</i> double mutants required only tyrosine for growth |CITS: [15983]|.  This suggested a role for IlvE in phenylalanine biosynthesis in the <i>tyrB</i>, <i>aspC</i> double mutants, although its role in strains with functional TyrB and AspC is unknown.

TYPES - Selenocysteine-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - L-selenocysteine biosynthesis I (bacteria)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3285599468:ingraham
COMMENT - Selenocysteine has been called the 21<sup>st</sup> amino acid.  It is an essential constituent of three proteins in <i>E. coli</i>: the formate dehydrogenases |FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGO-CPLX "FDH-O"|, |FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGN-CPLX "FDH-N"|, and |FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGH-MONOMER "FDH-H"|; each of them contains one selenocysteine residue.  The biosynthesis of selenocysteine is unique among amino acid biosyntheses because its defining step occurs while attached to a tRNA molecule.  The tRNA molecule, tRNA<sup>sec</sup>, serves only to insert selenocysteine into these proteins.  tRNA<sup>sec</sup> has an anticodon that recognizes the stop codon UGA; it also has properties that allow it to be charged with serine by the <i>serS</i>-encoded seryl-tRNA synthetase.  But it cannot insert serine at an UGA codon.  Only after it has been converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> by the action of selenocysteine synthetase can it recognize certain UGAs as sense codons and insert selenocysteine there.  Recognition of UGA as a sense codon and insertion of selenocysteine depends on adjacent sequences in mRNA termed SECIS (<b>se</b>leno<b>c</b>ysteine <b>i</b>nsertion <b>s</b>equence) and a special elongation factor termed SELB, the product of <i>selB</i>, which acts in place of EF-Tu in this special case.
/
/Selenophosphate donates selenium to seryl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> thereby converting it to selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup>.  The physiological source of its selenium, shown here as selenide, is not known for certain.  Selenite and selenate are transported by the |FRAME: ABC-70-CPLX "sulfate transporter"| |CITS: [3897189]|.  Their reduction <i>in vivo</i> to selenide may follow the sulfate reduction path |CITS: [9325431][9850565]|.  It has also been suggested that selenium is mobilised from free selenocysteine <i>in vivo</i> by the action of |FRAME: CPLX0-246| |CITS: [10829016][11889101][15653770]|.

COMMON-NAME - pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative branch)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY| is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of <i>E. coli</i>'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): D-ribose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which <i>E. coli</i> is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.  In addition, this pathway is an important source of reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, glucose-6-phosphate, and ends with the formation of two others, fructose-6-phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary oxidative portion, shown here, in which glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to ribose-5-phosphate, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which, through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

TYPES - Arsenate-Detoxification
COMMON-NAME - arsenate detoxification II (glutaredoxin)
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/While the jury is still out about whether Napoleon Bonaparte died of arsenic poisoning or cancer |CITS: [367316][6750413]|, it is agreed by all that arsenic is a potent toxin.  Indeed, the results of exposure to high arsenic concentration in drinking water in West Bengal, India, and Bangladesh are considered by some to be the worst public health disaster in recent history |CITS: [15276412]|.  The form of arsenic influences the type and severity of toxicity.  Arsenate (As<sup>V</sup>) is a structural analog of phosphate, and inhibits phosphorylation processes.  For example, ADP-arsenate spontaneously hydrolyzes, resulting in uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation |CITS: [518594]|, while arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>) has a very high affinity for thiol groups, and thus binds to and inhibits many key enzymes that have thiol groups in their active sites.  In addition, inorganic arsenic is a potent carcinogen |CITS: [12505313]|.
/
/Arsenate enters the cell via the phosphate transport systems, such as the <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: PITA-MONOMER| and |FRAME: ABC-27-CPLX "Pst"| systems.  Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes reduce intracellular arsenate to arsenite.  However, while prokaryotes can pump arsenite out of the cell by using a dedicated pump, multicellular organisms require other means of getting rid of the metal.  Certain mammals, including humans, continue by methylating the arsenite to several methylated forms that are excreted from the organism in the urine (see |FRAME: PWY-4202|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Most microorganisms are able to detoxify arsenic species by pumping them out of the cell.  This cytoplasmic detoxification system involves the <i>arsC</i>-encoded cytoplasmic arsenate reductase, which reduces arsenate to arsenite, and an efficient arsenite efflux pump consisting of a two-component ATPase complex.  The <i>arsA</i> gene product is a soluble ATPase subunit, while the <i>arsB</i> product is an integral membrane protein.  Arsenite is the preferred substrate of ArsB, as well as an activator of ArsA ATPase activity.  In many cases <i>arsB</i> and <i>arsC</i> are found in an operon without an <i>arsA</i> gene |CITS: [12165430]|.
/
/ArsC cytoplasmic arsenate reductases are found widely in microbes, and are found in almost all organisms with a genome larger than 2 Mb |CITS: [15691908]|.  There are three different clades of ArsC proteins in bacteria, which share no sequence similarity.  The first clade includes the glutathione-glutaredoxin-coupled enzymes, and is found in many Gram-negative bacteria, as well as carried on many plasmids.  The second clade consists of glutathione-only dependent enzymes, and is found only in yeast, while the third clade consists of thioredoxin-dependent enzymes, and is found in Gram-positive bacteria, as well as many Gram-negative proteobacteria.  In addition, archaebacteria also possess ArsC reductases.  The archaeal genes are closest to those of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [15691908]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidines can be catabolized through three different pathways.  The best characterized is the reductive pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6430| and |FRAME: PWY-3982|) in which pyrimidines are reduced to &beta;-amino acids, |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|.  The pathway is found in mammals, microorganisms and plants  |CITS: [13428755][13416173][8650301]|.  The oxidative pathway is only found in a few bacterial species and has not been characterized nearly as well.  In it uracil is converted to |FRAME: UREA| and |FRAME: MALONATE| via |FRAME: BARBITURATE| |CITS: [12981104][14955523]|.  A third pathway has recently been discovered in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [16540542]| and is described here.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize pyrimidine nucleosides and bases as the sole source of nitrogen at room temperature.  This novel pathway for pyrimidine degradation was discovered by a combination of functional and comparative genomics techniques including high-throughput microarray and phenotype analysis |CITS: [16540542]|.  The pathway depicted here represents a combination of experimental work and functional predictions based on the available evidence |CITS: [20400551]|.
/
/In the presence of a flavin reductase, |FRAME: G6523-MONOMER| catalyzes the first step in this pathway, the ring opening of uracil at the C4 carbonyl by a novel flavin hydroperoxide-catalyzed mechanism.  The initial product of the reaction appears to be |FRAME: CPD0-2338|, which is unstable and can be slowly reduced to ureidoacrylate |CITS: [20369853][20400551]|.  While the |FRAME: G6522-MONOMER "RutB"| enzyme is able to hydrolyze ureidoacrylate, it is thought to hydrolyze peroxyureidoacrylate <i>in vivo</i>, yielding carbamate and |FRAME: CPD0-2340|.  In a spontaneous reaction, carbamate decomposes into one molecule each of |FRAME: AMMONIA| and CO<sub>2</sub>.  The aminoacrylate peracid is thought to be reduced to aminoacrylate by the |FRAME: G6521-MONOMER|.  Aminoacrylate can then hydrolyze either spontaneously or enzymatically to  |FRAME: MALONATE-S-ALD| and a second molecule of ammonia.  Malonate semialdehyde appears to be toxic and can not be utilized further.  The compound may be detoxified by one of two malonic semialdehyde reductases to |FRAME: 3-HYDROXY-PROPIONATE|, which is then excreted into the medium.  The toxicity of malonic semialdehyde appears to limit growth on pyrimidines as the sole source of nitrogen.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Of the six existing hexitols, only three (D-mannitol, D-sorbitol [glucitol], and galactitol [owing to symmetry, D- and L-galactitol are identical]) occur naturally, and each of these can be utilized by <i>E. coli</i> K-12 as a total source of carbon and energy.  Each enters the cell via a specific phosphotransferase system, so the first intracellular species is the 6-phospho-derivative (in the case of galactitol, D-galactitol-1-phosphate and D-galactitol-6-phosphate are identical).  In all three cases, this sugar alcohol phosphate becomes the substrate for a dehydrogenase that oxidizes its 2-alcohol group to a keto group.  In the cases of mannitol and sorbitol, the resulting keto sugar phosphate is D-fructose-6-phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis and hence it flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy.  In the case of galactitol-1-phosphate, however, the product of the dehydrogenation is tagatose-6-phosphate, which becomes the substrate of a kinase and subsequently an aldolase (in a pair of reactions that parallel those of glycolysis) before it is converted into intermediates (D-glyceraldehde-3-phosphate and dihydroxy-acetone-phosphate) of glycolysis.

COMMENT - <H1>Aerobic pathway</H1>
/
/Although enzymes of the pathway handle both short and long chain fatty acids, it is the long chain compounds that induce the enzymes of the pathway |CITS: [6271734]|.  Each turn of the cycle removes two carbon atoms until only two or three remain.  When even-numbered fatty acids are broken down, a two-carbon compound remains, acetyl-CoA.  When odd number fatty acids are  broken down, a three-carbon residue results, propionylCoA.  This is further catabolized by the reactions of proprionate catabolism.  Unsaturated fatty acids, with cis double bonds located at odd-numbered carbon atoms, enter the main pathway of saturated fatty acid degradation by converting related metabolites of cis configuration and D stereoisomers, derived from breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids, to the trans- or L isomers of saturated fatty acid breakdown by an isomerase and an epimerase, respectively.  When cis double bonds are located at even-numbered carbon atoms, such as linoleic acid (cis,cis(9,12)-octadecadienoic acid), after the fatty acid is degraded to the ten carbon stage an extra step is required to deal with the resulting compound, trans,&delta;(2)-cis,&delta;(4)decadienoyl-CoA.  The enzyme 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, E.C. 1.3.1.34, converts this to trans,&delta;(2)decenoyl-CoA which enters the normal cycle at the point of the isomerase.
/
/<H1>Anaerobic pathway</H1>
/
/More recently, an anaerobic pathway of fatty acid metabolism has been characterized |CITS: [12535077]|.  Anaerobic &beta;-oxidation of fatty acids utilizes fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor |CITS: [15213221]|.  In contrast to the aerobic pathway, octanoate and decanoate can serve as substrates for the anaerobic fatty acid oxidation pathway |CITS: [12535077]|.  In the anaerobic pathway FadI, FadJ, and FadK serve functions parallel to those of FadA, FadB, and FadD in the aerobic pathway |CITS: [12535077]|.  
/
/The glyoxylate cycle is necessary for anaerobic or aerobic fatty acid oxidation to provide the carbon and energy for cell growth |CITS: [12535077]|.

CITATIONS - 18576672:EV-EXP:3423928617:keseler
COMMENT - |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| can serve as the sole source of carbon for <i>E. coli</i>.  Oleate is an
/unsaturated fatty acid and first undergoes two rounds of &beta;-oxidation (see |FRAME: FAO-PWY|),
/producing |FRAME: CPD0-1162|.  The original unsaturated bond is now located in the 5 position.
/
/While the majority of |FRAME: CPD0-1162| is completely degraded by further rounds of &beta;-oxidation,
/approximately 10% of the substrate enters a side pathway due to the production of a 3,5-unsaturated fatty
/acid, |FRAME: CPD0-1158|, from the 2,5-unsaturated |FRAME: CPD0-1162| by the enoyl-CoA isomerase
/activity of FadB.  |FRAME: CPD0-1158| can not be further metabolized by <i>E. coli</i>, since the
/organism lacks a &Delta;<sup>3,5</sup>,&Delta;<sup>2,4</sup>-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity. 
/Thioesterase III liberates the CoA moiety from |FRAME: CPD0-1158| by hydrolysis, thus avoiding the
/production of a dead-end compound that traps CoA.  The resulting |FRAME: CPD0-1159| is secreted into
/the growth medium.  |CITS: [14707139][18576672]|

COMMON-NAME - L-arginine degradation II (AST pathway)
CITATIONS - 9696779:EV-EXP:3527609376:keseler
COMMENT - This pathway (called the AST pathway for its crucial enzyme, |FRAME: ARGSUCCTRAN-MONOMER|) is the major arginine-degrading pathway found in <i>E. coli</i>.  It yields 2 molecules of ammonia and 2 of glutamate and can satisfy <i>E. coli</i>'s total nitrogen requirement, but not its total carbon requirement.  This pathway does, however, permit other organisms, for example <i>Klebsiella aerogenes</i>, to utilize arginine as a total source of carbon.  With the exception of |FRAME: CPLX0-7947| and |FRAME: SUCCORNTRANSAM-CPLX "succinylornithine transaminase"|, enzymes of this pathway from <i>E. coli</i> have not been characterized beyond assaying crude extracts.  Succinylornithine transaminase gained special attention and was originally designated as <i>argM</i> because is can substitute for acetylornithine transaminase (encoded by <i>argD</i>) in the biosynthesis of arginine.  The substrates of the two enzymes differ only in ornithine's being acetylated in the biosynthetic pathway and succinylated in the degradative pathway.

COMMON-NAME - L-arginine degradation III (arginine decarboxylase/agmatinase pathway)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3282411786:arnaud
COMMENT - This arginine catabolic pathway has been discovered in |FRAME: TAX-83333| by Shaibe et al.
/|CITS:[3897201]|.  The pathway is essentially identical to an anabolic pathway that is used by many
/bacteria for the biosynthesis of putrescine (see |FRAME:PWY-40| |CITS:[4908781]|.  Even though the main
/catabolic arginine pathway of |FRAME: TAX-83333| is the succinyltransferase pathway
/(|FRAME:AST-PWY|), this pathway provides an alternative route, and is used under certain growth
/conditions.  Interestingly, unlike |FRAME: TAX-83333|, wild-type <i>E. coli</i> strains are unable to use
/|FRAME:ARG| as a carbon source, even though they can use it as a nitrogen source |CITS:[3534538]|. 
/
/|FRAME: TAX-83333| has two forms of the enzyme arginine decarboxylase: a constitutive biosynthetic
/form, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10959| gene, and an inducible catabolic form, encoded by the
/|FRAME:EG11501| gene.  When the catabolic form is not expressed, the pathway operates only in an
/anabolic manner, catalyzing the biosynthesis of |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, which is used by the bacteria
/either directly or as a precursor for the biosynthesis of other polyamines
/(see |FRAME:POLYAMSYN-PWY|).  However, when the cells are grown in an arginine-rich medium,
/especially if the medium is acidic and conditions are semi-anaerobic, the catabolic arginine decarboxylase
/is expressed, and the pathway operates in a catabolic manner, feeding |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| via
/|FRAME:4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| and |FRAME:SUC| into the |FRAME:TCA| |CITS:[3157043]|.

COMMON-NAME - glycolysis II (from fructose 6-phosphate)
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the components of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA "TCA cycle"|. As such, its functioning is essential under all conditions of growth because it produces six (|FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules. Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.
/
/Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:
/
/i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and
/
/ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it
/can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.
/
/Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy.
/This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX "fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The standard glycolysis pathway (|FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS|) depicts the sugar input into the pathway as
/glucose. However, the glycolysis pathway is utilized for the degradation of many different types of sugars.
/
/This partial depiction of the glycolysis pathway is used with substrates other than glucose, such as |FRAME: ALLOSE|,
/|FRAME: CPD-9569| , |FRAME: MANNITOL| , |FRAME: SORBITOL| , |FRAME: MANNOSE| and |FRAME: SUCROSE|,
/which are processed into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|.
/D-fructose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis and is processed to the end product pyruvate, which is often fermented
/further into fermentation products such as |FRAME: ETOH|, |FRAME: Lactate| and |FRAME: ACET|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the components of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA|. As such, its functioning is essential under all conditions of growth because it produces six (|FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|,
/|FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules. Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.
/
/Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions:
/
/ i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and
/
/ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it
/can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.
/
/Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites. This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Glucose is not shown here as a component of glycolysis because when used by <i>E. coli</i> as a source of carbon and energy, glucose enters the cell via a phosphotransferase system (transport of glucose, |FRAME: CPLX-157|), the first intracellular species, therefore, being glucose-6-phosphate.
/<i>E. coli</i> does constitutively produce |FRAME:GLUCOKIN-MONOMER| (the intracellular enzyme that converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate) but it is not needed for the utilization of either exogenous or endogenous glucose |CITS: [9023215]|. Under anabolic stress conditions, it may be required to supplement levels of glucose 6-phosphate
/|CITS: [7786044]|.

COMMENT - It has long been known that many bacteria are able to produce |FRAME: HS| |CITS: [3299028]|.  However, the physiological role of H<sub>2</sub>S in nonsulfur bacteria was unknown.  A recent report has now shown that production of H<sub>2</sub>S serves to defend cells from antibiotics by mitigating oxidative stress |CITS: [22096201]|.
/
/This pathway is one of two pathways for hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis.  Neither of the two activities have been shown biochemically for the <i>E. coli</i> enzymes.  The function of |FRAME: ASPAMINOTRANS-DIMER "AspC"| as a cysteine transaminase is hypothesized based on sequence similarity to mammalian enzymes.  The function of |FRAME: EG11600-MONOMER "SseA"| was determined based on the phenotype of an <i>sseA</i> null mutant, which does not produce hydrogen sulfide |CITS: [22096201]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Phospholipids are important components of the inner and outer membranes of <i>E. coli</i>. Most phospholipids are |FRAME: Phosphoglycerides "phosphoglycerides"|. The simplest phosphoglycerides, which are known as |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE| (a phosphatidate), are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to two fatty acids and one phosphate group. The carboxyl group of each fatty acid is esterified to the hydroxyl groups on C-1 and C-2 of the glycerol molecule, while the phosphate group is attached to C-3 by an ester link.
/
/Most of the fatty acids of <i>E. coli</i> are contained in phospholipids. The three main phospholipids of <i>E. coli</i> are  phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Phosphatidylethanolamine comprises about 75% of the total phospholipid, with the latter two varying as to growth phase. Trace amounts of other phospholipids including monoacylphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylserine are also present.
/
/The fatty acid composition of <i>E. coli</i> phospholipids consists of palmitate, myristate, palmitoleate, and <i>cis</i>-vaccenate, with trace amounts of laurate, stearate, and <i>cis</i>-7-tetradecenoate. The proportions depend upon both growth phase and temperature. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids rises with decreasing temperature, which is thought to maintain membrane fluidity.
/
/Following the synthesis of the fatty acid components of phospholipids (see pathways under class |FRAME: Fatty-acid-biosynthesis|), they are transferred to a phosphorylated glycerol molecule (|FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|). The resulting |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE "1,2-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate"| is then converted to its activated derivative |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|. Following activation, it can then be modified to form other phsophoglycerides as shown in the pathway links.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| utilizing the PlsB and PlsC enzymes. It is found in some Gram-negative bacteria, primarily the |FRAME: TAX-1236|, including <i>E. coli</i>. When cells are grown on carbon sources other than glycerol, the first step of phospholipid biosynthesis is the NADH-dependent reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (a glycolytic intermediate) to <i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) catalyzed by |FRAME: GLYC3PDEHYDROGBIOSYN-CPLX|, the product of gene |FRAME: EG20091|. The enzyme is feedback-regulated by G3P which maintains a constant intracellular concentration of this metabolite |CITS: [6985897]|. When cells are grown on glycerol, |FRAME: GLYCEROL-KIN-CPLX| can produce G3P.
/
/The production of the intermediate 1-acyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate is catalyzed by membrane-bound PlsB (|FRAME: GLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|). It transfers fatty acids to position 1 of G3P, producing |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P|. PlsB enzymes can utilize either an acyl-[acp] (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1319|) or an acyl-CoA thioester (this pathway) as the acyl donor. <i>E. coli</i> can convert exogenous fatty acids into acyl-CoAs via FadD (|FRAME: ACYLCOASYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [6355102]|, which are also substrates for PlsB and PlsC.
/
/The addition of the second fatty acid acyl moiety at position 2 of G3P is catalyzed by PlsC (|FRAME: 1-ACYLGLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|), producing a 1,2-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate (a phosphatidate). This enzyme is universally expressed in all bacteria. As in the case of PlsB, it can utilize either an acyl-[acp] or a long-chain acyl-CoA thioester as the acyl donor.
/
/The a 1,2-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate formed by PlsC is then converted to its activated form |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|. This compound is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of all membrane phospholipids (as indicated in the pathway links and superpathway |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN-PWY|).
/
/It should be noted that most bacteria utilize a different route for the synthesis of 1-acyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate that involves genes <i>plsX</i> and <i>plsY</i>, as described in MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5981| |CITS: [16949372]|. Although <i>E. coli</i> retains genes |FRAME: EG11437| and <i>plsY</i> (|FRAME: EG11674|), |FRAME: EG10740| is used to synthesize 1-acyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate |CITS: [17645809]|.

COMMENT - In <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 the Rcs proteins are involved in a complex phosphorelay system that is believed to play a role in controlling the temporal expression of genes related to biofilm formation and may have a broader role as a global regulator controlling cell surface composition in response to changing environments. Numerous conditions that activate the Rcs phosphorelay have been observed including osmotic shock, dessication and perturbations in the integrity of the cell membrane. The Rcs regulon is large and includes genes for colonic acid capsule synthesis, cell division, motility and membrane lipoproteins. 
/
/The Rcs phosphorelay involves three separate proteins: RcsC, RcsD and RcsB.  Phosphate transfer occurs from the sensor kinase RcsC which autophosphorylates in response to a signal, to RcsD and then to the cytoplasmic transcription factor RcsB. RcsB, either alone or in combination with RscA, activates transcription from a wide range of genes, including those for capsule synthesis and some membrane proteins, and it negatively regulates flagella synthesis.
/
/The Rcs pathway responds to outer membrane and peptidoglycan damage and this response involves the accessory proteins |FRAME: RCSF-MONOMER "RcsF"| and |FRAME: G7741-MONOMER "IgaA"| |CITS: [18192383][23893115]|. IgaA is an essential inner membrane protein that inhibits the Rcs system |CITS: [25525882]|; RcsF is an outer membrane lipoprotein that turns on the signaling cascade upon envelope stress. During outer membrane or peptidoglycan related stress RcsF activates the signaling pathway by interacting with the inner membrane protein, IgaA - likely alleviating the inhibitory effect that this latter protein has on the Rcs phosphorelay. In unstressed cells, the Bam machinery continuously funnels RcsF through OmpA to form a surface exposed complex - in this model outer membrane or peptidoglycan stress disrupts Bam activity and newly synthesized RcsF is exposed to the periplasm where it binds IgaA and triggers the Rcs phosphorelay |CITS: [25525882]|.

TYPES - Purine-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - pseudouridine degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP:3546796616:keseler
COMMENT - A bewildering number of post-transcriptional modifications are introduced into cellular RNAs by different enzymes |CITS: [12581659]|.  The most abundant post-transcriptional nucleobase modification in cellular RNAs is the isomerization of |FRAME: URIDINE| to |FRAME: CPD-497|, which is carried out by the enzyme pseudouridine synthase in a reaction that does not require any cofactors.  In pseudouridine, uracil is bound to the ribose through C5 rather than through N1, as is the case for uridine.  The synthase severs the normal glycosidic C-N bond of uridine, flips the uracil moiety along its N3-C6 axis, and forms a glycosidic C-C bond with C5.  Pseudouridine is one of few molecules that have a glycosidic C-C bond.
/
/Pseudouridine synthases belong to four different families, which are represented in <i>E. coli</i> by the |FRAME: EG10454|, |FRAME: EG11177|, |FRAME: EG12609| and |FRAME: EG12044| genes.  The only sequence element that is absolutely conserved among the four families of enzymes is a catalytic aspartic acid |CITS: [9425056][11720289][10428788]|.
/
/Pseudouridylation is found in organisms from all kingdoms.  Mammalian rRNA contains about 100 pseudouridines per ribosome, and tRNAs contain an average of 3 - 4 pseudouridines.  While many eukaryotes possess the ability to degrade pseudouridine, mammals appear to have lost this ability, and pseudouridine is excreted in their urine.
/
/Pseudouridine has been shown to serve as a source of uracil for a strain of <i>E. coli</i> that is deficient
/in pyrimidine synthesis |CITS: [4882030]|.  It was shown that pseudouridine was first phosphorylated by a kinase to |FRAME: PSEUDOURIDINE-5-P| |CITS: [4334133]|, followed by hydrolysis to |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and |FRAME: URACIL| |CITS: [4912525]|.  The genes encoding these two enzymes have been discovered in |FRAME: TAX-364106|, a uropathogenic strain |CITS: [18591240]|.  The genes were cloned, and the enzymes were purified and characterized, confirming the proposed function.
/
/Similar genes were found in the genomes of many bacteria and almost all eukaryotes |CITS: [18591240]|.

COMMON-NAME - YpdAB Two-Component Signal Transduction System
COMMENT - YpdAB is a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) which functions in the carbon control network of <i>E.coli</i> K-12. YpdAB induces expression of |FRAME: YHJX-MONOMER "<i>yhjX</i>"|, encoding a predicted inner membrane transporter, in response to the presence of extracellular pyruvate |CITS: [23222720]|. YpdAB contributes to the control of nutrient scavenging which occurs upon entry into stationary phase under carbon starvation |CITS: [23222720]|.  Cross-talk between the YpdAB TCS and the |FRAME: PWY0-1559| has been demonstrated and the two systems are proposed to constitute a nutrient sensing regulatory network |CITS: [24659770]|.
/
/YpdA is an inner membrane protein predicted to function as a sensor kinase. YpdA may function as a sensor of extracellular pyruvate, transferring a phosphate group to the response regulator and transcription factor YpdB, which in turn activates expression of the inner membrane protein and putative transporter YhjX |CITS: [23222720]|. Activated YpdAB has a negative effect on the expression of |FRAME: G7942-MONOMER "<i>yjiY</i>"| - the target of the YehUT TCS |CITS: [24659770]|.

COMMON-NAME - purine ribonucleosides degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3374847453:keseler
COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can use all four naturally occurring purine ribonucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, inosine and
/xanthosine) as total sources of carbon and energy.  The first three (adenosine, guanosine, and inosine) are cleaved
/by the same <i>deoD</i>-encoded phosphorylase, yielding the corresponding purine bases (adenine, guanine, and
/hypoxanthine) and D-ribose-1-phosphate, which, after being converted to D-ribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that
/also can utilize D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate as a substrate, enters central metabolism through the nonoxidative
/branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.  In contrast, xanthosine is cleaved by a specific phosphorylase encoded
/by <i>xapA</i> before it enters the same pathway.  Adenosine may be deaminated before it enters the pathway.
/
/The amino nitrogens of adenosine and guanine, but not the ring-nitrogen of any of the four purines, generated as a
/by-product of this pathway, can serve as a total nitrogen source for <i>E. coli</i>.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two-component regulatory systems sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions.  In the prototypical system a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which, thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E. coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The ZraSR two-component system comprises ZraS - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and ZraR - the cytoplasmic response regulator. The role of the Zra system remains uncertain: it has been implicated in metal (specifically Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>) resistance |CITS: [11243806]| and more recently in the envelope stress response |CITS: [26438879]|.    
/
/ZraSR regulates expression of |FRAME: EG11918 "<i>zraP</i>"| which encodes a periplasmic zinc-binding protein; phosphorylated ZraR triggers divergent transcription of <i>zraP</i> and <i>zraSR</i>. Growth of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 in the presence of high external zinc or lead concentrations results in increased cellular levels of ZraR which are dependent on the presence of ZraS; direct sensing of Zn<sup>2+</sup> by ZraS has not been shown |CITS: [11243806]|. ZraP is a zinc responsive periplasmic protein with chaperone activity; zinc bound ZraP negatively regulates expression of <i>zraSR</i> and <i>zraP</i>; the ZraPSR system does not play a role in zinc resistance; it may be involved in the envelope stress response |CITS: [26438879]|.
/
/At one time this system was known as the HydH/G system since it was thought to be involved in regulation of hydrogenase 3 activity |CITS: [2666400]|.

COMMENT - The DcuSR two-component sytem comprises the membrane associated sensor kinase DcuS and the cytoplasmic transcriptional activator, DcuR. The DcuSR pathway controls the expression of genes relating to the catabolism of exogenous C4 dicarboxylates such as fumarate, malate, maleate, succinate, L-tartrate and aspartate during aerobic and anaerobic growth.
/
/DcuS is an integral membrane protein that contains a periplasmic sensing domain and a cytoplasmic PAS (Per-ARNT-SIM) - kinase domain |CITS: [9765574][9973351]|. Ligand binding at the periplasmic domain of DcuS stimulates ATP dependent autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue (His3449) with subsequent phosphotransfer to the cytosolic transcription factor DcuR; phosphorylation converts DcuR from a monomeric form with a low DNA-binding affinity to a dimeric form with high DNA-binding affinity |CITS: [12167640][14996819]|. Target genes of DcuR include <i>dctA</i> and <i>dcuB</i> encoding the aerobic and anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate transporters plus <i>fumB</i> and <i>frdABCD</i> encoding the anaerobically expressed fumarase and fumarate reductase respectively |CITS: [9765574][9973351][14996819][15073297]|.   
/
/DcuS requires the transport proteins |FRAME: DCTA-MONOMER "DctA"| (under aerobic conditions) or |FRAME: DCUB-MONOMER "DcuB"| (under anaerobic conditions) for normal function and specific interaction between DcuS and DctA has been detected <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [10482502][18957436][22780562]|.  The exact function of DctA and DcuB in the DcuSR system is not clear. It has been proposed that the DctA-DcuS (and presumably the DcuB-DcuS) interaction serves as a second stimulus input site that responds to transport or metabolic flux of C4-dicarboxylates |CITS: [23109544]| although evidence against this model has also been presented |CITS: [25135747]|.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two-component regulatory systems sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions.  In the prototypical system a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which, thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E.coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The BarA/UvrY two-component system comprises BarA - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and UvrY - the cytoplasmic response regulator. The BarA/UvrY two-component system is believed to play a role in central carbon metabolism via its regulation of the small non-coding RNAs |FRAME: CSRC-RNA "CsrC| and |FRAME: CSRB-RNA "CsrB"| |CITS: [12193630], [12694612], [9211896]|. BarA is a tripartate sensor kinase which is predicted to phosphorylate its cognate response regulator UvrY via a His&rarr;Asp&rarr;His&rarr;Asp phosphorelay |CITS: [7957084], [11022030]|. Autophosphorylation of BarA has been demonstrated in vitro as has the transfer of phosphate from phosphorylated BarA to UvrY |CITS: [11022030], [15522865]|. The physiological signals that activate the BarA/UvrY system are not well characterised. Aliphatic carboxylic acids such as formate, acetate and propionate have been shown to be an environmental stimulus for the BarA sensor kinase |CITS: [20118252]|.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can use both naturally occurring pyrimidine ribonucleosides (cytidine and uridine) as total sources of
/carbon and energy.  Uridine is cleaved by a phosphorylase yielding uracil and D-ribose-1-phosphate, which, after
/being converted to D-ribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that also can utilize D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate as a
/substrate, enters central metabolism through the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.  In contrast,
/<i>E. coli</i> lacks a phosphorylase capable of cleaving cytidine.  This nucleoside must be deaminated (thereby
/yielding uridine) before it can be cleaved.
/
/The amino nitrogen of cytidine, but not the ring-nitrogen of uracil, generated as a by-product of this pathway, can
/serve as a total nitrogen source for <i>E. coli</i> over its entire temperature range of growth.  However, this ring
/nitrogen does become available to serve as a total nitrogen source at room temperature via a pathway encoded by
/genes in the <i>rut</i> operon |CITS: [16540542]|.

COMMENT - In the absence of oxygen <i>E.coli</i> K-12 is able to generate energy using a variety of different substances as terminal electron acceptors. One such substance is trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) which, under anaerobic conditions, is reduced to TMA by the action of the periplasmic molybdoprotein |FRAME: TMAOREDUCTI-CPLX "TMAO reductase"|, encoded by the <i>TorCA</i> genes. TorSR is the two-component signal transduction system that controls the cells ability to use TMAO as an alternate electron acceptor. TorS is the membrane associated sensor kinase which detects the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the medium and phosphorylates its cognate response regulator, TorR. Thus activated, phosphorylated TorR binds to a region upstream of TorC and induces the <i>torCAD</i> operon. TorR has also been shown to  regulate the expression of genes involved in the response to extreme pH leading to the suggestion that the TorSR system also triggers alkaline stress defence mechanisms to counteract the increasing pH resulting from TMA production.
/
/The periplasmic |FRAME: G6515 "TorT"| protein acts upstream of the TorSR two-component system. TorT binds to TMAO and interacts with the periplasmic domain of TorS thus suggesting that the TorS activating signal may be a TMAO-TorT complex.

/The Cpx TCS comprises the membrane associated sensor CpxA and the cytoplasmic response regulator, CpxR |CITS: [    8294007]|. The Cpx system is a stress response pathway that activates proteases and chaperones in response to cell envelope damage (reviewed by |CITS: [22092948]|).  The CpxA sensor protein has both kinase and phosphatase functions. Under non-inducing conditions CpxA acts as a CpxR-phosphate phosphatase, ensuring that the sytem is not active; under inducing conditions CpxA functions as an autokinase and CpxR kinase. Phosphorylated CpxR is a dual transcriptional regulator; the size of the Cpx regulon is large - dozens of target genes have been identified with functions relating to protein folding and degradation, chemotaxis, multidrug efflux, DNA repair, bacterial adherence and motility (reviewed by |CITS: [16487683]|. 
/
/Activation of the Cpx system is complex, many inducing stimuli (eg. alkaline pH, high salt concentration, metals, surface adhesion) have been identified and activation likely occurs through a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms (reviewed by |CITS: [22092888]|. CpxP is a periplasmic accessory protein that acts to modulate the system; direct interaction between CpxP and CpxA inhibits the autophosphorylation of CpxA; under stress conditions CpxP is displaced from CpxA and the Cpx response is activated |CITS: [17259177], [21239493], [21317318]|. A second auxiliary regulator is the outer membrane lipoprotein NlpE, which is required for Cpx activation in response to surface adhesion |CITS: [11830644]|. Additionally CpxA may directly sense misfolded proteins and some stimuli corresponding to variations in central metabolites (such as acetyl CoA and cAMP) are thought to affect the activation of CpxR independently of CpxA

COMMENT - In <i>E.coli</i> K-12 the two paralogous two-component systems |FRAME: PWY0-1515 "NarXL"| and NarQP collaborate to control anaerobic respiratory gene expression in response to nitrate and nitrite. NarX and NarQ are the sensor histidine kinases, NarL and NarP the response regulators. The systems have a discriminatory response to nitrate and nitrite and there is cross talk
/between the sensor kinases and the response regulators. In this way a complex response to the dynamic ratio of nitrate and nitrite during anaerobiosis is mediated.

COMMENT - The UhpBA two-component signal transduction system (TCS) forms part of the <i>E. coli</i> Uhp system which is responsible for sensing and transport of the metabolic intermediate, glucose-6-phosphate. Sensing of external glucose-6-phosphate by this system involves the two inner membrane proteins |FRAME: UHPC-MONOMER "UhpC"| and UhpB which appear to act jointly  in the signalling process |CITS: [1569007], [8349544]|. UhpC is thought to act as the receptor for glucose-6-phosphate and to subsequently interact with UhpB, stimulating its kinase activity and resulting in the transfer of a phosphoryl group to the soluble transcription factor UhpA. The precise nature of the interaction between UhpC and UhpB is not known. Phosphorylated UhpA binds target sequences in the <i>uhpT</i> promoter and induces its expression |CITS: [3042748], [8999880]|. The inner membrane UhpT protein can transport a variety of phosphorylated sugars including glucose-6-phosphate |CITS: [2181257]|.

CITATIONS - 11583838:EV-EXP-TAS:3547499649:fulcher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/4-hydroxybenzoate (<i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate) is a precursor of the important electron carrier ubiquinone (see |FRAME: Ubiquinones|). In bacteria and fungi 4-hydroxybenzoate is produced from chorismate by the enzyme |FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER|. Chorismate is a key intermediate and branch point in the biosynthesis of many aromatic compounds including amino acids, quinones, catechols and some vitamins |CITS: [1644758][8012607]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER| catalyzes the first committed step in the pathway from chorismate to ubiquinol-8 (the reduced form of ubiquinone-8, |FRAME: RXN0-5309|). In this reaction the pyruvyl moiety is removed from chorismate by cleavage of a carbon-oxygen bond. Pyruvate is released with concomitant ring aromatization to produce 4-hydroxybenzoate. As shown in the pathway links, 4-hydroxybenzoate enters the ubiquinol-8 biosynthetic pathway via conjugation with all-<i>trans</i>-octaprenyl diphosphate |CITS: [11455603]|.
/
/|FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER| retains the product of the reaction, 4-hydroxybenzoate, and is efficiently inhibited by it, suggesting that this inhibition may present a control mechanism for ubiquinone biosynthesis |CITS: [11455603][11825618]|.

COMMENT - Energy taxis is the ability of bacteria to monitor their internal energy levels and respond by moving to a position that is optimal for their metabolic requirements. In <i>E. coli</i> energy taxis encompasses aerotaxis (response to an oxygen gradient) and redox taxis (response to a redox gradient). The molecular mechanisms of energy taxis are closely related to those of chemotaxis whereby bacteria respond to specific chemical attractants and repellents in their external environment (see |FRAME: PWY0-1518 "chemotactic two-component signal transduction"|). 
/
/Energy taxis in <i>E. coli</i> is achieved by a signal transduction system that responds to changes in the electron transport system. Two receptors sense changes in the ET system: Aer and Tsr. Aer senses changes in the redox state of the system via an FAD cofactor while  Tsr senses changes in proton motive force that result from perturbation of the ET system. Signals from Aer and Tsr are transduced via the CheA, CheW and CheY proteins, to the flagellar apparatus. CheY influences flagella rotation by direct binding to the |FRAME: FLIM-FLAGELLAR-C-RING-SWITCH "FliM"| protein - a component of the |FRAME: CPLX0-7450 "flagella motor switch complex"|. CheY and phosphoCheY  bind to FliM with different affinities, influencing the direction of flagellar rotation and facilitating movement.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two-component regulatory systems sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions.  In the prototypical system a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which, thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E. coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The RstBA two-component system comprises RstB - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and RstA - the cytoplasmic response regulator |CITS: [15522865]|. The RstA regulon includes genes involved in acid tolerance, curli fimbria formation and anaerobic respiration. PhoP directly regulates the <i>rstBA</i> operon and RstBA-PhoQP are thought to form a signal relay cascade involved in the adaptive response to acid conditions |CITS: [12813061], [17468243]|.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 the PhoQP two component system acts as a transcriptional regulator that responds to Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation and may play a role in survival in Mg<sup>2+</sup> limiting environments. PhoQ is the membrane associated sensor kinase which phosphorylates its response regulator PhoP, in response to low levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The PhoP regulon is large and includes genes with functions in magnesium transport,  acid resistance and lipopolysaccharide modification. Interaction between the PhoQP and |FRAME: PWY0-1490 "EvgSA"| two-component systems has been observed in <i>E.coli</i> and is mediated by the small protein |FRAME: MONOMER0-2841 "B1500"|. |CITS: [10464230], [12813061], [15126461]|.
/
/The PhoQP two component system also responds to the redox state of the periplasm whereby a decrease in oxidising activity (as seen in <i>dsbA</i> or <i>dsbB</i> mutants for example) results in the increased expression of PhoP regulated genes |CITS: [22267510]|. 
/ 
/PhoQP has been widely studied in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar <i>typhimurium</i> where it controls several virulence properties (reviewed in |CITS: [18792679]|. PhoP and PhoQ from <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. typhimurium</i> are 93% and 86% identical respectively however comparison of the <i>phoPQ</i> regulons from <i>E.coli</i> K-12 and <i>Salmonella typhimurium </i> reveals a limited overlap |CITS: [15883881]|.

CITATIONS - 2668953:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3489200465:amackie
COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two-component regulatory systems sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions.  In the prototypical system a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which, thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E. coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The EnvZ/OmpR two-component system comprises EnvZ - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and OmpR - the cytoplasmic response regulator |CITS: [15522865]|. The <i>E. coli</i> EnvZ/OmpR two-component system is best defined by its modulation of the outer membrane diffusion pores |FRAME: EG10671-MONOMER "OmpF"| and |FRAME: EG10670-MONOMER "OmpC"| in response to changes in medium osmolarity |CITS: [2668953]|. The mechanism by which EnvZ senses changes in osmolarity is not well understood but its function as both a kinase and a phosphatase has been well characterised and it is the interplay between these two functions that controls the cellular level of phosphorylated OmpR. In addition  to <i>ompF</i> and <i>ompC</i>, the OmpR regulon includes the outer membrane porin genes |FRAME: EG10280 "<i>fadL</i>"| |CITS: [12366850]| and |FRAME: G6877 "<i>tppB</i>"| |CITS: [8413182]| as well as genes with roles in regulating flagella biosynthesis and biofilm formation.

COMMON-NAME - L-asparagine degradation I
CITATIONS - 6339481:EV-EXP-IMP:3528211440:keseler
COMMENT - L-asparagine can serve as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen for <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [3514575][6339481]|.  Asparaginase hydrolyzes L-asparagine, generating ammonia and L-aspartate.  
/
/<i>E. coli</i> encodes three enzymes with asparaginase activity |CITS: [5339624][4962587][11053866]|.  However, only one of them, |FRAME: ANSA-CPLX|, has been shown to be required for utilization of L-asparagine.  This cytoplasmic enzyme does not appear to be regulated at the level of transcription, but it is allosterically activated by L-asparagine |CITS: [17451745]|, thus ensuring that L-asparagine is only utilized as a source of carbon and nitrogen when excess amounts beyond the normal protein synthesis requirements are available.
/
/A second cytoplasmic enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX0-263|, has only low levels of asparaginase activity and may thus not normally be involved in this process.
/
/The periplasmic asparaginase, |FRAME: ANSB-CPLX|, is highly active.  Its expression is induced by anaerobiosis via Fnr, indicating that its primary function may be the generation of fumarate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration |CITS: [JERLSTROM87][2407723]|.  Interestingly, this enzyme has been used as a treatment for cancer |CITS: [9768345][20423302]|.  In humans, asparaginase causes rapid decline of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid L-asparagine levels when administered to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, resulting in selective toxicity to malignant lymphoblasts, which have a relatively high nutritional requirement for this amino acid.

TYPES - L-Ornithine-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - L-ornithine biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3445031166:keseler
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/While the amino acid L-ornithine is not involved directly in protein synthesis, it is an important intermediate in many metabolic pathways of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PWY-4984|, |FRAME: PWY-6409| and |FRAME: PWY-6003|).  In some bacteria L-ornithine-containing lipids and genes involved in their biosynthesis have been identified, but other bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> do not contain ornithine lipids (reviewed in |CITS: [19703488]|) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-6818|).  In <i>E. coli</i> L-ornithine is a precursor of the amino acid L-arginine and the polyamine putrescine, which is in turn a precursor of the polyamine spermidine.
/
/In this pathway L-ornithine is biosynthesized from L-glutamate via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to L-proline biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PROSYN-PWY|), thus keeping the pathways leading to L-arginine and L-proline separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein).
/
/Two alternative pathways have evolved that differ in the way the key intermediate <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another key intermediate, <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine.  In this pathway, which is less common but is found in the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed by <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate synthase and <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, forming L-ornithine and acetate.  In the other pathway, which is found in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-ornithine is recycled onto L-glutamate, regenerating <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate (see |FRAME: ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|).  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the ornithine biosynthesis pathway of <i>E. coli</i>, L-glutamate is acetylated to <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate by the enzyme <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate synthase, encoded by the <i>argA</i> gene.  The acetyl donor for this reaction is acetyl-CoA.  <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-glutamate is then converted in several enzymatic steps to <i>N</i>-acetyl-ornithine.  The acetyl group is removed in the form of acetate by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, encoded by the <i>argE</i> gene, producing L-ornithine and acetate.  L-ornithine is a precursor of the amino acid L-arginine, as shown in the pathway link.

COMMENT - The ArcAB two-component system mediates <i>E. coli's</i> response to  changing respiratory conditions of growth and is a global regulator of gene expression under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. The system comprises ArcB - a membrane associated sensor kinase and phosphatase, and ArcA - a cytosolic transcription factor. Under anaerobiosis ArcB autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates ArcA via a four step His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay. Activated ArcA regulates the expression of numerous operons involved in respiratory and fermentative metabolism. During aerobiosis oxidised forms of quinone electron carriers signal the inhibition of  ArcB autophosphorylation and ArcB acts as a specific ArcA-P phosphatase.

COMMENT - |FRAME: B-ALANINE| is an important precursor of |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE| biosynthesis.  In bacteria,
/the main route of |FRAME: B-ALANINE| synthesis is the single-step decarboxylation of
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|.
/
/&beta;-alanine biosynthesis by L-aspartate decarboxylation appears to be exclusive to prokaryotes. 
/Eukaryotes employ alternative multi-step pathways to achieve the same goal (see |FRAME: PWY-3981|,
/|FRAME: PWY-3941| and |FRAME: PWY-3982|). 
/
/The enzyme catalyzing the decarboxylation of L-aspartate, |FRAME:CPLX0-2901|, is one of a small class
/of enzymes that use a covalently bound pyruvoyl prosthetic group.  The pyruvoyl group is thought to act
/analogously to a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor by forming a Schiff base with the amino group of the
/substrate and then serving as an electron sink to facilitate the decarboxylation |CITS: [2197977]|.

COMMON-NAME - PhoRB Two-Component Signal Transduction System, phosphate-dependent
CITATIONS - 2693738:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3486243563:amackie
COMMENT - In <i>E.coli</i> K-12, PhoRB is the two-component system for sensing and responding to variations in the level of extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi). Pho RB regulates the expression of a large number of genes (the Pho regulon) which have a role in the assimilation of environmental Pi or the use of alternate Pi sources.
/
/PhoR is the membrane associated sensor kinase which controls activity of the cytoplasmic response regulator and transcription factor PhoB. PhoR detects Pi only indirectly and its activity as a sensor kinase depends on its association with the phosphate transporter |FRAME: ABC-27-CPLX "PstSCAB"| and/or |FRAME: EG10735-MONOMER "PhoU"|. Accordingly signal transduction by Pi requires seven proteins (PhoR, PhoB, PstSCAB and PhoU) that interact in a membrane associated complex. 
/
/PhoRB signalling is believed to be a negative process - that is, activation of PhoB is the default state and excess environmental Pi is required to turn the system off. Under limiting environmental Pi, PhoR is believed to be in an active signalling conformation resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of PhoB and subsequent induction of the Pho regulon. Excess levels of Pi (>4uM) result in an inhibited form of PhoR which interferes with phosphorylation of PhoB and prevents its activity as a transcription factor. The Pst transporter and the chaperone like protein PhoU are both necessary for inhibition of the PhoRB system.

COMMENT - Copper is both an essential nutrient and a toxic substance and thus <i>E. coli</i> K-12 has evolved several pathways (both chromosomal and plasmid-borne) to control intra-cellular copper availability. One of these is the chromosomally encoded Cus system which includes a tripartite transporter |FRAME: CPLX0-1721 "(CusCFBA)"| that functions in copper and silver extrusion |CITS: [11004187], [11283292]|. CusSR is the two-component system which activates expression of the <i>CusCFBA</i> operon in response to elevated copper and silver concentrations. The Cus system appears to be important in anaerobic growth and under conditions of extreme copper stress |CITS: [11399769]|. 
/
/Typically, two component systems comprise a membrane associated sensor kinase which autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal and transfers a phosphoryl group to a cytoplasmic response regulator which thus activated, effects a response. The CusSR two-component system comprises CusS - the membrane associated sensor kinase and CusR - the cytoplasmic transcriptional activator. CusS senses increased periplasmic silver and copper concentration by an undefined mechanism and is required for the Ag(I) and Cu(I) dependent upregulation of the <i>cusCFBA</i> opeeron |CITS: [11399769], [22348296]|.

COMMENT - The EvgSA two component signal transduction system (TCS) comprises |FRAME: EVGS-MONOMER "EvgS"| - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and |FRAME: EVGA-MONOMER "EvgA"| - the cytoplasmic response regulator. The EvgSA TCS is believed to initiate a complex transcriptional cascade that functions for acid and drug resistance in <i>E.coli</i> |CITS: [19352034]|. Activation of the EvgSA system occurs under mild acidic conditions (pH 5-6) and in the presence of high concentrations of alkali metals |CITS: [24957621]|. 
/
/Activation of the EvgSA signal transduction system (through use of a constitutively active EvgS mutant) directly upregulates at least six genes/operons including the transcriptional regulator |FRAME: G6789-MONOMER "<i>ydeO</i>| which then upregulates <i>gadE</i> - the master regulator of acid resistance genes |CITS: [19352034]|.
/
/EvgS is a member of the 'unorthodox' sensor kinase class where a multistep phosphorelay occurs between alternating histidine and aspartate residues before the EvgA response regulator is activated |CITS: [8808618]| 
/
/Interaction between the EvgSA and |FRAME: PWY0-1458 "PhoQP"| two-component systems has been observed in <i>E.coli</i> and is mediated by the small protein |FRAME: MONOMER0-2841 "B1500"| |CITS: [15126461], [17998538], [18792678]|.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> movement is typically described as a random three-dimensional walk in which runs of movement in a straight line are punctuated by tumbles as the cell briefly stops and randomly reorients before moving off again. This swimming/tumbling behaviour results from alternating clockwise (tumbling behavior) and counterclockwise (straight swimming behavior) flagellar rotation. Chemotaxis is the ability of <i>E. coli</i> to move or 'swim' towards or away from specific chemical attractants and repellents and is achieved by regulating the probability of CW and CCW flagella rotation via a modified two-component signal transduction pathway - the chemotactic signal transduction pathway. Pathway components include the dual function histidine kinase |FRAME: CHEA-CPLX "CheA"|, the response regulators |FRAME: CHEY-MONOMER "CheY"| and |FRAME: CHEB-MONOMER "CheB"|, plus |FRAME: CHEW-MONOMER "CheW"|, |FRAME: CHER-MONOMER "CheR"|, and the transmembrane receptor proteins.
/
/CheA is a dual function cytoplasmic histidine kinase which, in conjunction with one of the transmembrane receptor proteins  (the so-called methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins - |FRAME: TSR-MONOMER "Tsr"|, |FRAME: TAR-MONOMER "Tar"|, |FRAME: TRG-MONOMER "Trg"| or |FRAME: TAP-MONOMER "Tap"|) and a linker protein CheW, forms a ternery signalling complex (|FRAME: TSR-CPLX "MCPI"|, |FRAME: TAR-CPLX "MCPII"|, |FRAME: TRG-CPLX "MCPIII"| or |FRAME: TAP-CPLX "MCPIV"|). Ligands interact with the receptor proteins and affect the flow of phosphoryl groups from CheA to two response regulators - CheY and CheB - neither of these proteins are transcription factors unlike the majority of two-component response regulators in <i>E. coli</i>. CheY influences flagella rotation by direct binding to the |FRAME: FLIM-FLAGELLAR-C-RING-SWITCH "FliM"| protein - a component of the |FRAME: CPLX0-7450 "flagella motor switch complex"|. CheY and phosphoCheY  bind to FliM with different affinities and influence the direction of flagellar rotation. CheB is a methylesterase which, along with CheR methyltransferase takes part in a feedback loop that  enables the pathway to adapt to background stimuli.

COMMENT - <i>Escherichia coli</i> uses several systems to adjust the concentration of the dominant intracellular cation, K<sup>+</sup>. Under normal physiological conditions the constitutively expressed K<sup>+</sup> transporters |FRAME: PC-52 "Trk"| and |FRAME: KUP-MONOMER "Kup"| are active but upon osmotic upshock or under K<sup>+</sup> limiting conditions the high affinity  K<sup>+</sup> transporter |FRAME: ATPASE-1-CPLX "KdpFABC"| is induced. Expression of <i>kdpFABC</i> is under control of the KdpDE two-component system (TCS) |CITS: [1532387], [1532388]|.
/
/KdpD is a membrane-bound sensor kinase which, upon activation, autophosphorylates and transfers a phosphoryl group to the cytoplasmic response regulator KdpE |CITS: [8223625], [8798785], [9099740], [11016946]|. Phosphorylated KdpE  induces expression of the <i>KdpFABC</i> operon. KdpD also has phosphatase activity and is able to dephosphorylate phospho-KdpE in response to K<sup>+</sup> levels |CITS: [9099740]|.
/
/The primary stimulus perceived by the KpdDE TCS is uncertain. Early work (|CITS: [6787588], [9748442]| and reviewed in |CITS: [1449064]|) suggested that the Kdp system was controlled by turgor pressure (the difference in osmotic pressure across the inner membrane) although this has been disputed |CITS: [8331081], [18245296]|. Other studies have focused on K<sup>+</sup> concentration, both intracellular and extracellular, as a defining stimulus |CITS: [11016946],[11371546], [10712703], [21372396], [23651428]|. Analysis and modeling of the Kdp system under conditions of limiting potassium suggests an inverse correlation between KdpDE phosphorylation and the intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration. Under this model low intracellular K<sup>+</sup> levels result in inhibition of the phosphatase activity of KdpD and increased expression of <i>kdpFABC</i> whereas an increase in free intracellular K<sup>+</sup> enhances KpdD phosphatase activity, leading to a decrease in phospho-KdpE and decreased expression of the high affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter |CITS: [24657232]|.   
/
/Dephosphorylated |FRAME: EG11682-MONOMER "PtsN"| directly activates the KpdDE phosphorelay resulting in increased expression of the high affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter. The physiological significance of this is not clear but it may serve to link potassium uptake with carbohydrate uptake |CITS: [19400808]|.

COMMENT - YehUT is a two-component system (TCS) that has been implicated in nutrient selection at the stage of growth when carbon sources become limiting eg. upon entry into stationary phase. Cross-talk between the YehUT TCS and the |FRAME: PWY0-1550 "YpdAB TCS"| has been demonstrated and the two systems are proposed to constitute a nutrient sensing regulatory network |CITS: [24659770]|.
/
/YehU is an inner membrane protein and member of the 5TM-Lyt (5 transmembrane receptors of the LytS-YhcK type) group of bacterial receptors |CITS: [22685278], [12914674]|. YehU forms a TCS with YehT - a LytTR-like response regulator which regulates expression of |FRAME: G7942-MONOMER "<i>yjiY</i>"|, encoding an inner membrane transporter belonging to the CstA family of putative peptide transporters |CITS: [22685278], [24659770], [24225317]|. The YehUT system is activated at the onset of stationary phase during growth in media containing peptides and amino acids as carbon source |CITS: [22685278], [24659770]|. Activated YehUT has an negative effect on the expression of |FRAME: YHJX-MONOMER "<i>yhjX</i>"| - the target of the YpdAB TCS |CITS: [24659770]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: KDO| (KDO) is a component of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  The majority of Gram-negative bacteria LPS contain at least one 2-keto 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate molecule.
/
/This pathway starts with the isomerization of |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| to |FRAME: ARABINOSE-5P|, followed by its conversion to |FRAME: KDO-8P| (KDOP), which is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called |FRAME: KDO-8PSYNTH-CPLX| (KDOPS).  The bacterial KDOPSs have been grouped in two classes, and plant KDOPSs belong to a third class |CITS: [15070398]|.
/
/In the next step the phosphate group is removed from |FRAME: KDO-8P|, generating KDO.  The last step of the pathway is the activation of KDO to |FRAME: CMP-KDO|.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two-component regulatory systems sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions.  In the prototypical system a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which, thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E. coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/Under anaerobic conditions <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 can utilise citrate as a carbon source provided that a second substrate such as glycerol or glucose is available for oxidation. The DpiBA  two-component system activates genes involved in anaerobic citrate catabolism. DpiB (CitA) is the membrane associated sensor kinase which autophosphorylates in response to citrate and transfers a phosphoryl group to the cytoplasmic response regulator DpiA (CitB). Phosphorylated DpiA activates the <i>mdh</i> gene and the <i>citCDEFXG</i> operon for citrate fermentation. It also activates the <i>exuTR</i> operon (with a role in hexuronate catabolism), possibly for the provision of an oxidisable co-substrate. |CITS: [18997424], [19202292]|

COMMON-NAME - QseBC Two-Component Signal Transduction System, quorum sensing related
COMMENT - In <i>E.coli</i> K-12, QseBC is thought to be a quorum sensing two-component system (TCS) involved in regulation of flagella biogenesis through activation of the |FRAME: CPLX0-3930 "<i>flhDC</i>"| operon - the principal regulator of flagellar biogenesis |CITS: [11929534]|. QseC is the membrane associated sensor kinase; QseB the response regulator. Characterisation of the QseBC TCS has been largely undertaken in enterohaemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> (EHEC) where it forms part of the signalling cascade that activates expression of virulence genes including those that control flagella expression. <i>qseB</i> and <i>qseC</i> from EHEC and <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are almost identical |CITS: [11929534]|.
/
/The <i>E coli</i> K-12 <i>qseBC</i> operon is activated by the AI-2 quorum sensing system but a direct effect of the AI-2 molecule on the phosphorylation status of QseC has not been demonstrated |CITS: [11929534]|. In EHEC autophosphorylation of QseC in response to the auto-inducer AI-3, has been reported |CITS: [16803956]| and the response regulator QseB has been shown to bind to the <i>flhDC</i> promoter |CITS: [16135237]|.

COMMENT - D-mannose can serve as a total source of carbon and energy for growth of <i>E. coli</i>.  Because
/mannose is taken up via a phosphotransferase system (PTS), the first intracellular species is
/D-mannose-6-phosphate.  |FRAME: MANNPISOM-MONOMER| converts D-mannose-6-phosphate to
/D-fructose-6-phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis, and hence it flows through the pathways of central
/metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy. 
/
/Utilization of mannose by <i>E. coli</i> does not require an inducer.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two component systems (TCSs) sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Typically, a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E. coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The BasSR TCS participates in <i>E.coli's</i> response to excess external iron. |FRAME: BASS-MONOMER "BasS"| is the membrane associated sensor kinase; |FRAME: BASR-MONOMER "BasR"| is the response regulator. In the presence of excess Fe(III), phosphorylated BasR acts as to induce transcription of the <i>arn</i> operon (<i>arnBCADTEF</i>) |CITS: [15322361]| involved in the modification of lipopolysaccharide. Microarray analyses have also implicated the BasSR TCS in <i>E. coli's</i> response to acid growth conditions |CITS: [15322361]|.

COMMON-NAME - NtrBC Two-Component Signal Transduction System, nitrogen-dependent
CITATIONS - 2874557:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3492397660:amackie
COMMENT - The NtrBC two-component system controls transcription of the <i>Ntr</i> regulon in E. coli - a collection of genes whose products facilitate survival under nitrogen limited growth conditions. The <i>Ntr</i> regulon is large and includes genes whose products assimilate ammonia, scavange nitrogen-containing compounds and integrate nitrogen assimilation with other metabolic processes.
/
/NtrB (NRII), encoded by <i>glnL</i>, is a dual function cytoplasmic protein with both histidine kinase and phosphatase activity. Depending on nitrogen availability, NtrB can autophosphorylate and donate a phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator, NtrC (NRI, product of <i>glnG</i>), or it may act as a phosphatase and catalyse the rapid dephosphorylation of NtrC-P. The phosphatase and kinase activities of NtrB are regulated by the homologous signal proteins |FRAME: PROTEIN-PII "PII"| (<i>GlnB</i>) and |FRAME: PII2-CPLX "PII2"| (<i>GlnK</i>) and the |FRAME: EG11411 "uridyyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme"| (product of <i>GlnD</i>). Phosphorylated NtrC activates transcription of numerous genes and operons - whose products include |FRAME: GLUTAMINESYN-OLIGOMER "glutamine synthetase"| (GS), transporters, amino acid permeases and catabolic enzymes which function collectively to facilitate survival under nitrogen limitation.

COMMENT - The CreCB two-component system consists of the membrane associated sensor kinase CreC and the cytoplasmic response regulator CreB. The CreCB regulon includes genes with diverse functions leading to the suggestion that it is a global regulator |CITS: [11350954]|.

/
/CreC was initially called PhoM as it was shown to transphosphorylate PhoB in PhoR mutant strains in response to glucose |CITS: [7021308], [2228961]|. Other carbon sources were able to mimic the effect of glucose |CITS: [1551836]| and PhoM was renamed CreC (carbon source responsive).

COMMON-NAME - L-lyxose degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - L-lyxose is an uncommon sugar in nature, and wild-type <i>E. coli</i> can not utilize it as a sole source of carbon and energy.  However, mutations can arise that allow <i>E. coli</i> to metabolize L-lyxose through the use of enzymes of the rhamnose, arabinose and 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate systems. 
/
/L-lyxose enters the cell through the <i>rhaT</i>-encoded rhamnose transporter.  It is then isomerized to L-xylulose by |FRAME: RHAMNISOM-MONOMER|. 
/
/Two types of mutations then allow further utilization of L-xylulose.  Not shown here, a mutated from of |FRAME: RHAMNULOKIN-MONOMER| can phosphorylate L-xylulose, yielding L-xylulose-1-phosphate.  Further metabolism to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycolate occurs through the |FRAME: RHAMNULPALDOL-CPLX| and |FRAME: ALD-CPLX| enzymes.  These products can enter glycolate degradation and glycolysis |CITS: [1650346]|.  
/
/As shown here, L-xylulose can be phosphorylated by |FRAME: LYXK-CPLX| in a mutant in which YiaJ, the repressor for the <i>yiaKLMNO-lyxK-sgbHUE</i> operon, has been disrupted |CITS: [7961955]|.  L-xylulose-5-phosphate is then further metabolized by |FRAME: EG12286-MONOMER| (so far only a predicted function) and either of two L-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerases (SgbE or AraD) to D-xylulose-5-phosphate, which then enters the |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY| |CITS: [9525947][10913097]|.
/
/The enzymes of |FRAME: RHAMCAT-PWY| and |FRAME: ARABCAT-PWY| are inducible by L-lyxose as well |CITS: [1650346][10913097]|.

COMMON-NAME - autoinducer AI-2 biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - 11489131:EV-EXP-IDA:3446387577:keseler
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Cell-to-cell communication in bacteria is accomplished through the exchange of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression as a function of cell density. Many processes benefit from community cooperation, including bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development.
/
/Cell to cell signaling through quorum sensing in bacteria occurs through three main processes LuxR-LuxI, LuxS/AI-2, and AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine.  The LuxR-LuxI process controls signaling through autoinducer 1 (AI-1) which is an <i>N</i>-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL).  It was first described in <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> as a regulator of bioluminescence.  However <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> lack LuxI and do not synthesize AHLs, although the product of gene <i>sdiA</i> recognizes AHLs from other bacterial species.  The LuxS/AI-2 process controls both intraspecies and interspecies signaling.  It was first described as an extracellular signal produced by the marine bacterium <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> to control luciferase expression |CITS: [7984107][9990077]|.  In <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> AI-2 activates transcription of the <i>lsr</i> operon encoding an ABC transporter, the LsrB subunit of which binds AI-2 (see |FRAME: ABC-58-CPLX|).  The AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine process involves recognition by gut commensals of autoinducer produced by self, other bacteria, or human hormones.  In <i>E. coli</i> AI-3 interacts with a membrane-bound protein QseC which is part of the QseB-QseC two component system.
/
/AI-2 production depends upon growth conditions.  Factors include nutrients, pH, osmolarity, oxygen, growth rate and stress factors.  However, its exact role in cell signaling is still controversial and there is evidence that its function may be metabolic |CITS: [16352847][16385049][16321939]|.  A role for AI-2 in pathogenesis also remains to be established although transcriptomics studies have suggested that AI-2 may have a role in the regulation of virulence in enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [18256823]|. The <i>E. coli</i> AI-2 network has also been the subject of different modeling approaches |CITS: [19695305][17170762]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/One of the main bacterial autoinducers is autoinducer 2 (AI-2) which mediates the quorum sensing 2 (QS-2) system.  Its biosynthesis is catalyzed by the LuxS enzyme which also participates in the SAM cycle (see |FRAME: PWY-6151|). The LuxS enzyme is found in many bacteria including <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>.  Its role in AI-2 biosynthesis is suggested by the presence of the Lsr ABC transporter, the LsrB protein of which serves as the AI-2 receptor in many of these organisms |CITS: [18803868]| (see |FRAME: ABC-58-CPLX|).
/
/The precursor of AI-2 is synthesized by the enzyme <i>S</i>-ribosylhomocysteine lyase, which also catalyzes a step in the SAM cycle.  The enzyme converts <i>S</i>-ribosyl-L-homocysteine to L-homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione. Within the SAM cycle, the main product of the enzyme is L-homocysteine.  In AI-2 biosynthesis 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione is of major importance as it appears to be nonenzymatically converted in a series of chemical modifications to the mature autoinducer.
/
/The exact nature of the chemical transformations depends on the species. In <i>E. coli</i> and most pathogenic bacteria that form AI-2 the spontaneous transformations include cyclization to (2<i>R</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,4-dihydroxydihydrofuran-3-one and hydration to the final autoinducer (2<i>R</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran. This form of the autoinducer, which was first characterized from <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, was shown to be different from the form that was initially described from <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> (see below) and is recognized by the LsrB periplasmic binding protein |CITS: [15350213]|.
/
/Members of the order Vibrionales produce a different form of the autoinducer. In those organisms, 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione appears to form a different stereoisomer, namely (2<i>S</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,4-dihydroxydihydrofuran-3-one, which hydrates to (2<i>S</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran and forms a complex with a borate ion to form (2<i>S</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran-borate |CITS: [11823863][18803868]|,  (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-6154|). The mechanism that controls which stereoisomer is formed is still not understood.

COMMENT - The TCA pathway is a catabolic pathway of aerobic respiration.  It generates energy and reducing power.  It is the first step in generating precursors for biosynthesis.  When acetate is the carbon source, citrate synthase is rate-limiting for the TCA cycle. |CITS: [3889909][3332995]|  Respiration is an ATP-generating process in which compounds act as electron donors through a chain of electron transfer to electron acceptors.  Aerobic respiration uses oxygen as the final acceptor.  Anaerobic respiration uses several organic compounds as acceptors such as fumarate, nitrate and hydrogen.  During the chain of electron transfer, protons (H+) are transported outside the cytoplasmic membrane, generating a proton motive force.  Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, the PMF energy is captured as ATP, catalyzed by a multisubunit  ATPase.

COMMON-NAME - glucose and glucose-1-phosphate degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/It is well known that <i>Escherichia coli</i> can use glucose as a sole source of carbon and energy.  The D isomer of glucose is widely found in nature and the &beta;-D-glucose anomer is predominant in aqueous solution |CITS: [FRANKS87]|.  Exogenous &beta;-D-glucose enters the cell through outer membrane porins and is then actively transported into the cell via the inner membrane phosphotransferase system (PTS) which transforms it into &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate as it crosses the cell membrane.  &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate is also produced biosynthetically during gluconeogenesis.  &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate is one of the basic precursor metabolites for biosynthetic pathways.  It is also a substrate for the central degradative pathways glycolysis and the pentose phosphate cycle.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> can also grow on exogenously supplied glucose-1-phosphate (minimal medium containing glucose 1-phosphate) as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]|.  Endogenous &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is an intermediate in the metabolism of glycogen and galactose.  It is a building block for the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, which is used in some biosynthetic pathways.   Reviewed by Mayer, C. and W. Boos in |CITS: [ecosal]| (see below).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The dashed line connecting D-glucose with &beta;-D-glucose is meant to show that the pathway is possible, but incompletely defined.  The anomeric form (&alpha; or &beta;) of the D-glucose product of EC 3.1.3.10 is not specified by the EC and it was not found in the literature for the indicated phosphatases.  However, if &alpha;-D-glucose is produced, it may either spontaneously convert to &beta;-D-glucose, or <i>E. coli</i> aldose-1-epimerase (mutarotase, EC 5.1.3.3) could convert it to &beta;-D-glucose |CITS: [7966338]| and in |CITS: [4711601]|.
/
/Substrates &beta;-D-glucose and &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate may be derived from exogenous sources, or endogenously produced, as indicated by the input pathway links.  In general, the ability to utilize sugars and their modes of utilization are strain-dependent in <i>Escherichia coli</i>.
/
/Exogenous &beta;-D-glucose uptake via the PTS curbs the utilization of other exogenous sugars, which is known as the glucose effect.  This effect is lost if &beta;-D-glucose becomes limiting.  Under these conditions &beta;-D-glucose can also enter the cell without phosphorylation, via outer membrane porins and the Mgl ABC transporter (not shown).
/
/Endogenous &beta;-D-glucose can be produced by pathways for the degradation of glucose-containing disaccharides such as maltose (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|) trehalose, lactose and melibiose, as shown in the pathway links.  In contrast to exogenous &beta;-D-glucose  which is phosphorylated by the PTS, endogenous &beta;-D-glucose is phosphorylated by glucokinase before entering central metabolism, as shown in the pathway links (in |CITS: [9023215]|).  More recently, a role for glucokinase and glucose in a complex regulatory mechanism for maltose utilization involving Glk, MalT, Mlc and PtsG has been proposed |CITS: [19028900]|.
/
/It is possible that high levels of &beta;-D-glucose could accumulate inside the cell under certain conditions.  It has been shown that the maltose acetyltransferase product of gene <i>maa</i> efficiently acetylates both maltose and &beta;-D-glucose (not shown).  Evidence suggests that acetylation could be a detoxification mechanism in which acetylated &beta;-D-glucose diffuses from the cell |CITS: [7012137] [1856235]|. 
/
/There is evidence that &beta;-D-glucose can be oxidized to glucono-&delta;-lactone (glucono-1,5-lactone) by inner membrane glucose dehydrogenase.  However, the fate of the glucono-&delta;-lactone remains unclear.  It has been reported that membrane vesicles from glucose-grown <i>E. coli</i> oxidized glucose to gluconate in the presence of pyrrolo-quinoline quinone, a cofactor for glucose dehydrogenase |CITS: [3926746]|.  A gluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.17) has been partially characterized in <i>E. coli</i>, but its D-gluconate product was not specifically identified |CITS: [4625870]| and no gene encoding this enzyme has been identified.  D-gluconate can be degraded by a glucose utilization pathway that was described early |CITS: [14882337]|, as shown in the pathway link.  In addition, more recent work suggested possible excretion of D-gluconate although this compound was not specifically identified |CITS: [20215780]|.
/
/&alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is reversibly converted by phosphoglucomutase to &alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate.  &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is used in glycogen biosynthesis (see |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|) and is produced during glycogen degradation (see |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|).  &alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate may spontaneously convert to &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate in the physiological pH range |CITS: [14275652]|.  In addition, a glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase had been identified in <i>E. coli</i> ATCC 9637 that could catalyze this production of &beta;-D-glucose 6-phosphate.
/
/Several phosphatases may catalyze the production of D-glucose (anomeric form unspecified) from &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate.  The product of gene <i>agp</i> is a periplasmic enzyme that scavenges glucose and allows <i>E. coli</i> to grow with glucose-1-phosphate as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]| and in |CITS: [12782623]|.

COMMENT - The detoxification of the highly toxic formaldehyde is a major biochemical necessity for most life forms. 
/<b>Several different pathways for formaldehyde detoxification are known in bacteria, encoded by unrelated or distantly 
/related genes</b>.  
/
/Perhaps the best characterized is the pathway involving glutathione (GSH)-dependent 
/NAD-linked formaldehyde dehydrogenase (GSH-FDH) and formyl-GSH hydrolase (FGH).
/GSH-FDH enzymes are a well studied class of the alcohol dehydrogenase protein family (class III ADH ) 
/|CITS: [ 1872853]| that have been discovered in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 
/Unlike many alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes, GSH-FDH do not exhibit 
/appreciable activity with short aliphatic alcohols. Instead, GSH-FDH enzymes catalyze the NAD-dependent 
/oxidation of long-chain alcohols or hydroxylated fatty acids. Specifically, S-hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH), an 
/adduct formed spontaneously by glutathione (GSH) and formaldehyde (HCHO) , is both the preferred <i>in vitro</i> 
/and presumed <i>in vivo</i> substrate for GSHFDH enzymes. Even though it is formed spontaneously, in certain
/bacteria  S-hydroxymethylglutathione production is accelerated by a dedicated enzyme, S-hydroxymethylglutathione
/synthase |CITS: [8631716][8892832][11173978][12904537][7798140][12196016]|.

COMMENT - The &beta;-glucoside |FRAME: CHITOBIOSE| is the major breakdown product of |FRAME: CHITIN|, the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose.  <i>E. coli</i> is capable of using <i>N,N'</i>-diacetylchitobiose as the sole source of carbon |CITS: [9405618]|.  
/
/Chitobiose is imported and concurrently phosphorylated to |FRAME: DIACETYLCHITOBIOSE-6-PHOSPHATE| by the |FRAME: CPLX-155 "chitobiose PTS transporter"|.  Recent evidence suggests that this is followed by deacetylation of the unphosphorylated acetylglucosamine moiety at the reducing end of |FRAME: DIACETYLCHITOBIOSE-6-PHOSPHATE| by |FRAME: EG12198-MONOMER| |CITS: [22797760]|.  |FRAME: CPD0-2501| is subsequently hydrolyzed by the glycosyl hydrolase |FRAME: EG10144-MONOMER| to |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINE| and |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P|.  |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P| enters the |FRAME: GLUAMCAT-PWY| pathway for conversion to |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|, which enters glycolysis.  The fate of D-glucosamine is currently unclear; when used as a carbon source, D-glucosamine enters the cell via a PTS transporter and is thereby phosphorylated.  It is possible that an intracellular D-glucosamine kinase activity enables utilization of this compound.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Since the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is a very complex process, many organisms possess various salvage pathways that enable them to rescue thiamine fragments obtained from the environment.  This pathway describes the salvage of |FRAME: HMP| (HMP), a degradation product of thiamine that can be generated by thiaminase enzymes.
/
/The salvaged HMP is phosphorylated to form |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|, which is incorporated into the <i>de novo</i> thiamine biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [18054064]|.  In most cases the salvage reaction is catalyzed by the biosynthetic enzyme that catalyzes the following reaction, which is part of the <i>de novo</i> pathway.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize |FRAME: D-SERINE| as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen for growth |CITS: [1090588]|.  D-serine also has a bacteriostatic effect due to its effect on the biosynthesis of L-serine and pantothenate |CITS: [4574697]|.  Detoxification of D-serine and its utilization as a carbon and nitrogen source are accomplished by a single enzyme, |FRAME: DSERDEAM-MONOMER| |CITS: [14216615]|.  D-serine ammonia-lyase catalyzes the deamination of D-serine to form pyruvate and ammonia; expression of the enzyme is induced by D-serine |CITS: [13271312][14216615][14216616]|.

COMMENT - Because L-arabinose enters <i>E. coli</i> either by a low-affinity proton-driven transporter (AraE) or a high-affinity ATP-driven system (AraFGH), its first intracellular form is unphosphorylated.  Then an isomerase and a kinase convert it to L-ribulose-5-phosphate.  An epimerase converts L-ribulose-5-phosphate to D-xylulose-5-phosphate, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, which thereby flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy.

CITATIONS - 20693992:EV-EXP-IDA:3491080184:caspi
COMMENT - |FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is an essential cofactor for carboxyl group transfer enzymes such as |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, and is required by all forms of life |CITS: [ColiSalII]|. 
/
/Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years.  The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [20693992]|.
/
/Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure.  The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, describe the synthesis of the precursor of the pimelate moiety.  The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.
/
/The origins of the biotin carbon atoms in <i>E. coli</i> are known from <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis of products labeled <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [8125118][Indrajit94]|.  The C3, C5 and C7 carbons are derived from carbon C1 of acetate, while the C2, C4 and C6 carbons are derived from carbon C2 of acetate.  The C1 carbon originates from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|.  This labeling pattern indicated that the pimeloyl moiety of biotin is formed by head-to-tail incorporation of three intact acetate units, similar to the synthesis of fatty acids |CITS: [Indrajit94]|.  As the biotin C1 and C7 atoms show different labeling patterns, free pimelic acid (a symmetrical molecule) could not be an intermediate, and thus it has been assumed that |FRAME: CPD-558| is the precursor |CITS: [Webb07]|.
/
/The elucidation of the pathway proved difficult, mostly since only two genes, |FRAME: EG10119| and |FRAME: EG10122|, were implicated in the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety |CITS: [4563978][8830257][4877129]|.  Based on these finding, there have been several suggestions that enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are involved, although none of these suggestions could explain the full process |CITS: [Indrajit94][13930373]|.  An inclusive model was finally suggested in 2010 |CITS: [20693992]| and later refined.  Based on this model, |FRAME: EG10119 "BioC"| converts the free carboxyl group of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| to its methyl ester by transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| |CITS: [22965231]|.  The newly acquired methyl group mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains, and enables the esterified |FRAME: Malonyl-acp-methyl-ester| to enter the fatty acid synthetic pathway.
/
/Two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) produce |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACP-methyl-esters "pimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester"|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG10122 "BioH"| to give |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs "pimeloyl-[acp]"|.  The [acp] protein is then removed in a complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EG10121 "BioF"|, forming |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, the first intermediate in biotin ring assembly.
/
/According to this model, the introduction of the methyl ester early in the pathway disguises the biotin synthetic intermediates so that they become substrates for the fatty acid synthetic pathway.  When the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety is complete and disguise is no longer needed, the methyl group is removed to free the carboxyl group that will eventually be used to attach biotin to its target metabolic enzymes.
/
/An <i>in vitro</i> system that uses dialyzed cell extracts was used in combination with several mutant strains and purified proteins to verify the proposed pathway |CITS: [20693992]|.

COMMENT - 5'-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a side product of the |FRAME: BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-1303| pathways.  Many organisms are able to recycle MTA via the |FRAME: PWY-4361| pathway.  However, while the <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: CPLX0-1541| can hydrolyze MTA to adenine and methylthioribose (MTR), MTR can not be further metabolized and is excreted |CITS: [16788729]|.  No transporter for MTR is currently known.
/
/Excretion of MTR entails a loss of sulfur, which may explain why putrescine rather than spermidine is the major polyamine in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [10939241]|. 
/
/In early experiments, 5'-methylthioribose was shown to be a normal biosynthetic product that is secreted into the growth medium by <i>E. coli</i> B |CITS: [4203512]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-10247 Sulfoquinovose| is a major component of organo-sulfur compounds in nature |CITS: [428677]|.  It is synthesized by higher plants, mosses, ferns, algae and most photosynthetic bacteria and serves as the polar headgroup of the sulfolipid in photosynthetic membranes |CITS: [15012227][17334828]|.
/
/Bacteria that are able to utilize sulfoquinovose as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth were isolated, and a degradation pathway that is analogous to glycolysis was proposed |CITS: [11171207][14602597]|.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/It was recently shown that <i>E. coli</i> can also utilize |FRAME: CPD-10247| as its sole source of carbon and energy for growth.  The enzymes involved in this pathway were initially identified by analysis of differences in the proteomes of cultures grown with glucose vs. sulfoquinovose |CITS: [24463506]|.  
/
/|FRAME: CPLX0-7683| catalyzes the initial isomerization of |FRAME: CPD-10247| to |FRAME: CPD-16501|.  |FRAME: EG11848-MONOMER| phosphorylates |FRAME: CPD-16501| to |FRAME: CPD-16502|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG11846-MONOMER| to form |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| and |FRAME: CPD-16503|.  |FRAME: CPLX0-7794| reduces |FRAME: CPD-16503| to |FRAME: 2-3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate| (DHPS) in an NADH-dependent reaction. 
/
/The final products of this pathway are |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, which powers the cell via |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS|, and |FRAME: 2-3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate DHPS|, which is excreted and can be further degraded by other bacteria.

TYPES - 3-Dehydroquinate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - 3-dehydroquinate biosynthesis I
COMMENT - |FRAME: CHORISMATE| is an intermediate in the synthesis of three amino acids: |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|. In addition it is a precursor of folic acid, ubiquinone, menaquinone, and enterochelin |CITS:[4200844][BSUB225]|. Chorismate is synthesized from |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|, which can be synthesized in different pathways in different organisms.
/
/This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|, which is synthesized from the common central metabolism intermediate |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P| in two steps. The pathway describes the first part of the chorismate pathway (see |FRAME: ARO-PWY|) |CITS: [16963634]|. 
/
/The first reaction in the pathway is catalyzed by three separate enzymes (isozymes), each of which is subject to feedback inhibition by one of the three amino acids that are synthesized from chorismate - |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|. The enzyme subject to regulation by tryptophan (encoded by |FRAME: EG10080|) cannot be inhibited more than 60 percent, ensuring that sufficient enzymatic activity is present to permit synthesis of the other four metabolites synthesized from chorismate even in the presence of all three amino acids |CITS: [Pittard04]|.

CITATIONS - 3309152:EV-EXP-IDA:3589072284:amackie
COMMENT - Through a two-step process, <i>E. coli</i> is able to use 2-phenylethylamine as a sole carbon and energy source although this capability is strain dependent. <i>E. coli</i> K-10, a derivative of K-12, is able to grow on phenylethylamine as a sole carbon and energy source at 30<sup>o</sup>C but not at 37<sup>o</sup>C |CITS: [3309152]|. <i>E. coli</i> K-12 MG1655 and W3110 can both use phenylethylamine as a sole carbon or nitrogen source but the K-12 strain CSH7 cannot |CITS: [23913322]|. The first enyme of the pathway is the |FRAME: AMINEOXID-CPLX "TynA"| copper monoamine oxidase which has a high specificity for phenylethylamine |CITS: [9109378]|. TynA is located in the periplasm which may serve to reduce the amount of toxic hydrogen peroxide entering the cytoplasm. Phenylacetaldehyde, produced in the periplasm must then cross the inner membrane before it is oxidised by a cytosolic dehydrogenase. The transport protein responsible for this has not been identified. 
/
/Hydrogen peroxide readily diffuses across the outer membrane in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 |CITS: [23913322]|. Growth of the bacteria on phenylethylamine also induces the |FRAME: PD00214 "OxyR"| response and the production of hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes |CITS: [23913322]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - N-acetylglucosamine, which is relatively abundant in nature, being a constituent of chitosan, chitin, the
/cell walls of fungi as well as the cell walls, capsular polysaccharides, and outer membranes of bacteria, is
/an excellent total source of carbon, energy and nitrogen for <i>E. coli</i>.  Because it enters the cell via
/a specific phosphotransferase system (PTS), the first intracellular species is
/N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate.  Following the sequential removal of its acetyl and amino groups, it
/enters glycolysis as D-fructose-6-phosphate and hence flows through the pathways of central metabolism
/to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy. 
/
/Growth on glucosamine is slower than growth on N-acetylglucosamine.  The limiting factor appears to be the level
/of expression of |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINE-6-P-DEAMIN-CPLX| |CITS: [15838023]|.

COMMON-NAME - L-glutamate biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - There are two pathways by which <i>E. coli</i> synthesizes glutamate from ammonia.  If complex
/sources of nitrogen are available, still other pathways (see below) become available and take over
/glutamate synthesis.  The pathway shown here is one of the steps in one of the pathways by which
/glutamate is synthesized from ammonia.  The other step (|FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|) in this pathway is
/the synthesis of glutamine from ammonia.  Then in the step shown here that amido group is transferred to
/&alpha;-ketoglutarate yielding glutamate.  Because glutamine biosynthesis utilizes glutamate and the
/reaction shown here yields 2 molecules of glutamate, these two reactions function as a cycle (see
/|FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|), each turn of which produces one molecule of glutamate at the expense of
/one molecule each of ammonia, ATP, NADPH, and &alpha;-ketoglutarate.  The other
/ammonia-to-glutamate pathway, the one catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase
/(|FRAME: GLUTSYNIII-PWY|), also utilizes NADPH, and &alpha;-ketoglutarate, but it does not require
/ATP to drive the reaction.  The K<sub>m</sub> for ammonia in this reaction is much higher than the
/K<sub>m</sub> for ammonia in ATP-driven cyclic pathway.
/
/The two ammonia-to-glutamate pathways are regulated so as to operate under different environmental
/circumstances.  The ATP-independent pathway functions when ammonia is abundant; the ATP-driven
/pathway functions when concentrations of ammonia are low.  The ATP-independent pathway offers
/significant energy savings because when functioning, the ATP-driven pathway utilizes over 10 percent of
/the cell's total expenditure of ATP.
/
/If complex sources of nitrogen are available, glutamate can be synthesized from arginine
/(|FRAME: AST-PWY|) or proline (|FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I|) or from &alpha;-ketoglutarate by
/transamination of the amino group from arginine or aspartate. 
/
/The complexity of glutamate biosynthesis reflects the quantitatively central role that this amino acid plays
/in the metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>.  It is a major constituent of <i>E. coli</i>'s proteins and because it is
/a major nitrogen donor for other biosyntheses, about 80% of the cell's nitrogen flows through glutamate
/when <i>E. coli</i> is growing on a medium containing ammonia as the total source of nitrogen.

/This pathway is important to <i>E. coli</i> because sugar acids, which are significant nutrients in both of

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 GDP-alpha-D-mannose is a precursor for the biosynthesis of GDP-L-fucose, as indicated in the pathway link. GDP-L-fucose is the nucleotide-activated form of L-fucose, a monosaccharide constituent of colanic acid. In the Enterobacteriaceae colanic acid (M antigen) is a polyanionic extracellular heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with D-glucose, L-fucose, D-galactose, and D-glucuronate sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with <i>O</i>-acetyl and pyruvate side chains |CITS: [4902806 ][4941627]| (see pathway |FRAME: COLANSYN-PWY|). 
/
/In other bacteria, GDP-alpha-D-mannose is a precursor or participant in the synthesis of deoxyhexoses, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and organic solutes. In eukaryotes GDP-alpha-D-mannose is a key substrate in glycoconjugate formation and is a precursor for the biosynthesis of important compounds. Examples of such pathways are listed in MetaCyc under compound |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first two enzymes in the pathway catalyze isomerizations that interconvert phosphorylated aldohexoses (&beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate, D-mannose-6-phosphate) and phosphorylated ketohexoses (D-fructose-6-phosphate). The reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: MANNPISOM-MONOMER| that produces D-mannose-6-phosphate is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the activated mannose donor GDP-&alpha;-D-mannose. D-mannose-6-phosphate is then converted to GDP-D-mannose by the action of phosphomannomutase and mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase |CITS: [GaoIntJMassSpec05][8759852]|.
/
/Genetically engineered variants of this pathway in <i>E. coli</i> have been reported and are potentially useful in the production of mannosylglycerate |CITS: [12514000]| and fucosyloligosaccharides |CITS: [21293904]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/L-fucose is an important monosaccharide found in a diverse array of organisms. It is a carbohydrate component of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, mammalian and plant glycoproteins and various plant cell wall polysaccharides. Fucosylation is performed by fucosyltransferases which require the activated form GDP-L-fucose as the donor substrate. The formation of GDP-L-fucose occurs via two routes, a <i>de novo</i> synthesis route from GDP-&alpha;-D-mannose (this pathway), and a eukaryotic salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-fucose from free L-fucose (see |FRAME:PWY-6|).  
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of GDP-L-fucose from GDP-D-mannose comprises three catalytic steps: a 4,6-dehydration, a 3,5-epimerization, and a 4-reduction. The first reaction step is catalyzed by |FRAME: GDPMANDEHYDRA-CPLX|, which involves the formation of the intermediate GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose. This compound is also a common intermediate in the synthesis of other bacterial deoxyhexoses derived from GDP-D-mannose (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: PWY-5738| |FRAME: PWY-5739| |FRAME: GDPRHAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5740|). In bacteria (including <i>E. coli</i>), fungi, plants and humans, the second and third reactions have been shown to be catalyzed by a single bifunctional polypeptide, GDP-fucose synthase |CITS:[12881408][9525924][8910301][20035716]|.
/
/In the Enterobacteriaceae colanic acid (M antigen) is a polyanionic extracellular heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with D-glucose, L-fucose, D-galactose, and D-glucuronate sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with <i>O</i>-acetyl and pyruvate side chains |CITS: [4902806 ][4941627]|. The sugars must be activated in the form of nucleotide sugars (such as |FRAME: GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE|) before their assembly |CITS: [8759852] [8763957]| (see pathway COLANSYN-PWY). Colanic acid biosynthesis has been linked to a cluster of 19 <i>wca</i> genes that includes <i>wcaG</i> (<i>fcl</i>) encoding GDP-fucose synthase |CITS:[8759852][9473059]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/L-fucose is biosynthesized as the sugar nucleotide GDP-L-fucose. Its biosynthesis from GDP-D-mannose begins with dehydration of this compound to GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose by the product of gene <i>gmd</i>. Then the bifunctional GDP-fucose synthase catalyzes the two-step (epimerase/reductase) synthesis of GDP-fucose from GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose via a GDP-4-dehydro-6-L-deoxygalactose intermediate |CITS: [9473059]|. The overall reaction is defined by EC 1.1.1.271 and is carried out at a single active site on the enzyme |CITS: [19053199]|.
/
/This pathway requires NADPH as a reducing cofactor. Overexpression of endogenous NADPH-regenerating enzymes in recombinant <i>E. coli</i> increased GDP-L-fucose production under optimized conditions |CITS: [21538115]|. In another study, overexpression of |FRAME: CPLX0-322| encoded by gene <i>gsk</i> led to a significant improvement of GDP-L-fucose production. This was attributed to the increased level of intracellular GMP as a source of GTP which is required for this pathway (as shown in the pathway link to |FRAME: PWY-5659|) |CITS: [22159740]|.

COMMENT - Cell-to-cell communication in bacteria is accomplished through the exchange of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers.  This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression as a function of cell density.  Many processes benefit from community cooperation, including bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development.
/
/One of the paradigms of quorum sensing is that the signaling molecule accumulates in the extracellular medium.  However, some bacteria, including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, can take up and degrade the autoinducer AI-2.  The role of this process in the context of its natural multi-organism habitat is not fully understood yet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The AI-2 degradation pathway has been elucidated in <i>E. coli</i>.  The expression of transmembrane transporter proteins and degradation enzymes is regulated by the presence of AI-2.  After uptake, AI-2 kinase phosphorylates AI-2 to 5-phospho-AI-2.  This product then undergoes isomerization to P-HPD, followed by transfer of an acetyl group to coenzyme A and release of dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
/
/Notably, both end products are intermediates in central carbon metabolism.  In fact, <i>E. coli</i> can utilize AI-2 as the sole source of carbon and energy, although very poorly compared to carbon sources such as glucose and ribose.  This may be due to an imbalance in the CoA/acetyl-CoA ratio that is created by the final reaction of the pathway |CITS: [25225400]|.
